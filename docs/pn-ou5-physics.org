- But supposedly, it is 11.76 km/s at Ha
  - which would give
    - 11.76 6563 / 3e5 = 0.257 at Ha
    - 11.76 5007 / 3e5 = 0.196 at [O III]

** Crazy idea for estimating the instrumental widths better
- The narrowest line that I have in the data is the ISM [N II] component
- We could measure its width with the 150 micron and 70 micron slit
- Then we could plot \sigma^2 against slit-width^2
  - The intercept at zero slit width should give the intrinsic sigma of the line
  - The sqrt of the slope should give the instrumental sigma versus slit width
  - This is assuming that the "optical" instrumental width is small, and all is due to the finite slit width
    - Meaburn says that resolution is at least 30 microns, so that seems a reasonable approximation
** We could also measure the H temperature of the ISM
Using the linewidth method with Ha and [N II]

- For He++, Corradi 2015 find that the ion fractions for their entire slit are
  - He+ : 0.70
  - He++: 0.30
- We could estimate what the maximum value of He++ is
  - The width of the He II profile is 7/9 times width of Ha (assumed the same as He I), so the interior value of He++/He is 0.3 (9/7) = 0.38
  - We can use the recombination rates to estimate what the ionizing luminosity must be in the He II continuum (h\nu > 4 Ryd)
  - And also check that it is optically thick in midplane
* Empirical measurements
- Diameters:
  - Inner shell
    - 9 to 12 arcsec
    - mean 10.4 \pm 0.4
    - [[id:22069844-53A0-4130-8CF6-B86D0526053F][details here]]
  - Outer shell
    - end bits have diameter of 16 to 17 arcsec
  - Third shell (cone and fishtails)
    - 26 arcsec, but very uncertain
- Heights
  - Both shells have a sharpish outer boundary
  - Inner shell
    - 16 or so    
  - Outer shell
    - 26 or so
    - although co-added spectrum would argue for 32
- Aspect ratios: H / D
  - inner 16 / 10.4 +/- 0.4 = 1.54 +/- 0.06
  - outer 26 / 16.5 = 1.58 with large uncertainty
  - these are amazingly consistent
- Velocity splitting
  - [[id:478343AB-FDFD-4EA9-A338-FFC7B0809E0C][Details given below]]
  - Inner shell
    - 26 km/s
  - Outer shell
    - 37 km/s
  - Third shell
    - 70 km/s
  - D / V
    - Inner: 0.4
    - Outer: 0.43
    - Third: 0.37
    - So almost the same for all of them within 10%

- We should check these with pyNeb
- But we will get j \propto T^-1 approximately for the constant density case
- Cal be much steeper at low temperatures, especially if we are at constant temperature
*** Fraction of emission measure
- We have \omega = EM_cool j_cool / (EM_cool j_cool + EM_warm j_warm)
- Put \xi = EM_cool  / (EM_cool + EM_warm ) = (EM_cool / EM_warm) / (1 + EM_warrm / EM_cool)

- This is different from what I measured in the slit G of 8.7
- So I now get arccos(1.1 +/- 0.3 / 10.4 +/- 0.4) = 84 +/- 2
- *Alternative version*
  - From the [[id:DAE29C3F-03B0-47F3-88F1-B5814A08E940][next section]], I get a slightly larger diameter of 13.2 because the above is basically measuring the inner edge
  - This then gives i = arccos(1.1 +/- 0.3 / 13.2 +/- 0.2) = 85 +/- 1

:END:
- See the notebook [[file:../notebooks/04-01-coadd-slits.py][04-01-coadd-slits]] in section "Minor axis spatial profile"
- I look at fitting gaussians to the brightness profile of a thick cylindrical shell with inner, outer radii r_in, r_out
- Results as follows:
  - Gaussian peak radius is \approx r_in
  - Gaussian fwhm is \approx 1.7 (r_out - r_in)
  - So thickness H = (r_out - r_in) \approx 0.6 FWHM
  - And mean radius = 0.5 (r_out + r_in) \approx PEAK + 0.3 FWHM
- For the inner shell on the equator, I find
  - PEAK = 4.4 arcsec
  - FWHM = 7.4 arcsec
- Implying
  - r_in = 4.4 \pm 0.2
  - H = 3.7
  - r_out = 8.1 \pm 0.2
  - mean r = 6.6
  - mean diameter D = 13.2
- /update [2025-05-20 Tue]/ In the notebook I have r_in, r_out = 4.3, 8.8, which seems more reliable
- *So I need to reconcile this with the above measurements*
  - It means that the diameters I have above are from the peaks, so are the inner surface
    - So we all agree that this is about 9 arcsec on the equator
    - For the velocities, we need to check that the peak of the line profile corresponds to the inner edge

- So 2.6 \pm 0.2 is good enough
- Supposedly, it should be 1.9 arcsec, but that needs to be broadened by the seeing
  - sqrt(1.9**2 + 1.6**2 ) = 2.4839, so that is close enough, especially since the image quality seemed worse in the x direction

- Strangely, this is smaller than the seeing width
** Flux and surface brightness
- Using the ha-imslit-median.fits image, I will try and do a flux calibration, so we can measure the surface brightness in physical units
  - The naive way is just to use the mean surface brightness for the big box and put that equal to the mean surface brightness from the Ha flux
  - But we need to subtract off the contribution of 3 stars (the central star and two others)
- Total flux
  - From a rectangular box that is 20 * 26 arcsec, which corresponds to the 10% peak brightness contour

- *Important correction*
  - In order to capture all the flux from the nebula, we need to use the biggest box possible
    - Assuming the bg subtraction is good enough, there should be little penalty from using a bigger box (except it would include more stars that we would need to subtract)
  - *But* for comparison with the mean surface brightness, we need to use the npix area of the nominal ellipse of semi-axes = 10, 13 arcsec, which gives the 11.4 arcsec nominal radius
  - I have now measured the npix area of this ellipse and get npix = 10209
  - As opposed to the 12998 I was using earlier
  - This means that the reference brightness will be higher, which means that the derived EM will be lower, which is what I want to get the density down a bit

  - Here I subtract the 3 stars from the total to get the net flux, then divide by the number of pixels in the big bo to get the mean surface brightness
  - So the answer is that 0.5765 value in the FITS image corresponds to the mean surface brightness of
    - S(Ha) = 3.96e-04 erg /cm^2 /s /sr
    - EM = 5200 pc cm^-6
    - T_5 = 0.43 K
- Inner shell versus outer shell fluxes
  - We can do the same but for a smaller box that only includes the inner shell
  - Use a 18 x 16 box
  - Total flux is 5253.4374
  - Only first two stars fall in this box
    - Net inner flux = 5000.3 = 5000.3089 / 5885.8505 = 0.8495 of total flux

** Emission measures, densities and masses of components
- We can estimate densities from observed emission measures if we assume a geometry
- We will use a distance of 4.0 kpc (uncertainty 0.7 pc or 0.18 relative or 0.08 dex)
  - 1 arcsec = 4000 au / pc = 0.0194 pc
- Inner shell geometry from [[id:DAE29C3F-03B0-47F3-88F1-B5814A08E940][More sophisticated shell measurements]]
  - r_in, r_out = 4.3, 8.8 arcsec
  - height 16 arcsec (-8 to +8)
    - easiest to determine from the kinematics
  - Path lengths through shell
    - On axis 2 (r_out - r_in) = 9.0 arcsec = 0.1746 +/- 0.0314 pc
    - Max value 2 sqrt(r_out^2 - r_in^2) = 15.4 arcsec = 0.2988 +/- 0.0538
  - Volume pi (r_out^2 - r_in^2) H = 2963.15019086 arcsec^3 = 0.0216 pc^3
    - Compare with the equivalent spherical volume using the nominal radius of 11.4 arcsec
    - (4 pi / 3) 11.4**3 = 6206 arcsec^3 = 0.0453 pc^3
- Outer lobes geometry
  - Easiest thing to measure is its height
    - Extends to +18 in N and -16 in S
    - But the central (-8 to +8) section seems missing
    - So height of 34 but with 16 removed
  - Inner radius from peak-peak distance of the ears gives D = 17 +/- 0.2, R = 8.5 +/- 0.1
  - Outer radius will have to come from width
    - In notebook I found that thickness is about 0.6 times fwhm
    - Measurements of outer half-width hm for the ears after masking out stars: 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 1.8
    - H = 2 0.6 vmeane([2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 1.8]) = 2.82 +/- 0.33
  - Therefore, r_in, r_out = 8.5, 11.3
  - On-axis path length = 5.6 +/- 0.6 = 0.1086 +/- 0.0116 pc
  - Ears path length = 14.9 +/- 0.9 = 0.2891 +/- 0.0175
  - Volume pi (r_out^2 - r_in^2) (H_out - H_in) = (11.3**2 - 8.5**2) pi (34 - 16) = 3135 arcsec^3 = 0.0229 pc^3
- Polar knots geometry
  - Extent along slit is 8 arcsec, so assume sphere of radius 4 arcsec
    - This is consistent with fact that they are still seen in the slit with displacement of +3 arcsec
  - z = 2 4 = 8 +/- 2 arcsec = 0.1552 +/- 0.0388 pc
  - Volume = 2 4 pi 4**3 / 3 = 536 arcsec^3 = 3.9147e-03 pc^3
- Outermost lobes geometry
  - Assume "cones" are the outer part of an ellipse
    - i =  84 +/- 2 so sin i = 0.1045 +/- 0.0347
    - So a/b of ellipse will be about 10
  - Inner radius is about 15 arcsec
  - Thickness looks similar to outer lobes - so about 3 arcsec
  - Question is, what is height?
  - With infinite height, then peak depth d z = sqrt( (15 + 3)**2 - 15**2) = 9.9499
    - But at a small angle with a finite height, we are limited to h / sin i = 10 h
    - So this only becomes important when h < 1 arcsec, which seems unlikely
  - Simplest assumption is that h is same as thickness, so about 3 arcsec
  - so d z = 10 +/- 3 arcsec = 0.194 +/- 0.0582 pc
  - Volume pi (r_out^2 - r_in^2) H = ((15 + 3)**2 - 15**2) pi 3 = 933 arcsec^3 = 6.8126e-03 pc^3

*** Table of EM, density, M_i
- First row gives mean surface brightness and equivalent EM in pc cm^-6, which comes from the dereddened Ha flux.
- This is used with the measurements of surface brightness from median image to find EM for other components (inner shell and outer ears)
- And the inner shell one is used to calibrate in turn the spectral slit intensities to find the EM of components that are seen in the spectra
- The line-of-sight depths dz in pc are calculated for each component according to its geometry (see above)
- The rms density is calculated as sqrt(EM / dz)
- The volume V is also calculated for each component in pc^3
- The ionized mass is calculated as
  - M_i / M_sun = (m_p / M_sun) n V (pc/cm)**3 = 0.0247 n V

**** Effects of T variation on emission measure
- We were assuming Ha emission coefficient of 3.1213e-25 erg cm^3 /s for 13,000 K
- This was never very accurate because the T variation is steeper than we had supposed
- Pyneb says it should be 2.75e-25
- At 6000 K, it should be 5.65e-25

- So this calculation says that the inner shell is 84% of the total flux from the nebula
- This is consistent with when I did this using apertures, for which I got 85%
  - Originally I got 71% but I had made two mistakes
    - Partly because the box I was using for the inner shell was 14x14, whereas elsewhere I am assuming r_out = 8.8 and h = 16, so I should use an 18 x 16 box
    - And partly because I was not calculating the reference surface brightness correctly. Now that is fixed by using the number of pixels in the nominal ellipse
  - 
*** Discussion of density and ionized mass
- The density in the inner lobes now comes out to be more than twice as large as the density from the [S II] ratio
  - The reason for this is that the volume is now less than the equivalent spherical volume that I was using earlier

    - From below we are estimating \theta = 11.4 arcsec, so \Omega = \pi \theta^2 = 408.3 sq arcsec = 9.5964e-09 sr
    - At 5GHz, we have  (c^2 / 2 \nu^2 k) = 1.3019e+17
    - So T = 1.3019e+17 (3.2 +/- 0.4) 1e-3 1e-23 / 9.5964e-09 = 0.4341 +/- 0.0543 K

    - *log T_b - log F_5 - log \theta relation*

      - log F_5 = log T_b + 2 log \theta - 1.2463
  - Supposedly
    F(Hα) = 1.73e-10 erg cm−2 s−1 (S_{1.4} / mJy)
  - I do not think this is right. It should be about 1e-12
- This means that the intrinsic Ha flux is
  - 1e-12 3.6 = 3.6e-12 = 4.2 times observed flux
- So c(H a) = log10(4.2) = 0.62
- Relation between c(Ha) and c(Hb)
  - Frew cites the Howarth (1983) reddening law
  - For the Galaxy this is
    : X(x)= R + 2.56 (x-1.83)-0.993 (x-1.83)2
    - where X is A_\lambda/E(B-V) and x = 1 micron / \lambda
  - But that is only valid for x < 1.83, which excludes Ha. They have another fit for longer wavelengths

  - This implies c(Ha) / c(Hb) = 1.07/1.58 = 0.68
- So c(H b) = 0.62 /0.68 = 0.912
  - whereas the paper says 1.23 +/- 0.3 for c(H b) derived in this way
  - perhaps because they are using the T = 13 kK, which will reduce the conversion factor a bit
  - From the Balmer lines they find c(Hb) = 0.95 ± 0.25 assuming R_V = 3.1
    - so intrinsic / observed Ha flux is 10**(0.68 (0.95 ± 0.25) ) = 4.4259 +/- 1.7325
    - so intrinsic flux is 8.5e−13 (4.4259 +/- 1.7325) = (3.8 +/- 1.5)e-12  erg cm−2 s−1
    - so that is a 40% uncertainty in the flux, which is mainly due to uncertainty in the reddening correction
- Ha luminosity = 4 pi D^2 F = (4.5467e+32 +/- 1.7947e+32) D_kpc^2 erg/s = 0.1435 D_kpc^2 L_sun

* Return to emission measure versus radio and optical surface brightness
- I want to get to the bottom of the discrepancy in the distance scales, so I need to have a reliable conversion between radio free-free brightness temperature and optical Balmer line surface brightness

:END:
- From Osterbrock & Ferland
  : \tau_\nu = 8.24e-2 T^-1.35 \nu^-2.1 EM
  - where EM is in cm^-6 pc, T is in K and \nu is in GHz
- So with T_e = 13,000 K and \nu = 5 GHz we have
  - \tau_5 = 9.2080e-09 EM
- Brightness temperature, T_b = T_e (1 - exp(-\tau)) \approx \tau T_e
- T_b = 1.1970e-04 EM
** Balmer line surface brightness versus emission measure
- First do H alpha version in units per steradian
- Osterbrock has emission coefficient (4 \pi j / n_e n_p) = 2.87 1.24e-25 erg cm^3 /s at 1e4 K = 3.5588e-25 erg cm^3 /s
  - Alternative derivation: emission coefficient = \alpha_Ha E_Ha
  - E_Ha = h c / 6563 ang = 6.62606876e-27 2.99792458e10 / 6563 1e-8 = 3.0267e-12 erg
  - \alpha_Ha = 2.87 (6563/4861) 3.03e-14 = 1.1741e-13
  - => emission coefficient = 3.5536e-25 at 1e4, which is the same
- T dependence is roughly T^-0.5, so at 13,000 K this is 3.1213e-25 erg cm^3 /s
- S(Ha) = \int j d z =  (4 \pi j / n_e n_p) \int n_e n_p dz / 4 \pi
- S(Ha) = 3.1213e-25 EM pc / 4 \pi = 7.6644e-8 EM erg /cm^2 /s /sr
- Now convert to H beta and to square arcsec
- S(Hb) = S(Ha) / 2.87 (206265)**2 = 6.2769e-19 EM erg /cm^2 /s /arcsec^2
- Check for Ou 5
  - S(Ha) = 3.9598e-04 erg /cm^2 /s /sr => EM = 5166.5 pc cm^-6
  - S(Hb) = 3.1024e-15 erg /cm^2 /s /arcsec^2 => EM = 4942.6 pc cm^-6
  - These are not quite the same because S(Hb) was calculated assuming a Balmer decrement of 3 instead of 2.87 
** Radio-to-optical conversion factors
- Combining the previous two sections, we can put the Balmer line surface brightness in terms of the radio brightness temperature at 5GHz
- T_b / K = 1.1970e-04 EM
- S(Ha) / (erg /cm^2 /s /sr) = 7.6644e-8 EM = 6.4030e-04 (T_b / K)
  - log T_b = 0 is log S(Ha) = -3.1936
- S(Hb) / (erg /cm^2 /s /arcsec^2) = 6.2769e-19 EM = 5.2439e-15 (T_b / K)
** Compare the distance scales
- I will look at a brightness temperature of 1 K, which is more or less in the middle of all the PN samples, and compare what the different methods predict for the nebula radius
*** Frew 2016
- Principal scale is S(Ha), so 1 K corresponds to 6.4e-4 erg /cm^2 /s /sr
  - log S = -3.19
- From the full sample they have log S = −3.63(±0.06) log r− 5.34(±0.05)
  - log R = (-3.19 + 5.34) / −3.63 = -0.5923
- R = 10**-0.5923 = 0.2557 pc
*** Bucciarelli & Stanghellini 2023
- Scale is S(Hb), so 1 K corresponds 5.2439e-15 erg /cm^2 /s /arcsec^2
  - log S = -14.2803
- log R = (−0.242 ±0.0042) log S − (4.2 ±0.057)
- log R = -0.7442
- R = 10**-0.7442 = 0.1802 pc
*** Ali 2022
- This uses T_b, so we can directly read off their intercept value
- log R = -0.5987
- R = 0.2519 pc
- Basically the same as Frew

- The [S II] density is 125 \pm 40 from Corradi
- With an angular radius of \theta in arcsec, the radius is
  R = 4.8481e-03 \theta D_kpc pc
- So this gives an alternative way of estimating the VEM
  - assuming a filling factor of f for the dense gas
- VEM = (4 pi / 3) n^2 R^3 f = 7.46e-03 \theta^3 D_kpc^3 f pc^3 cm^-6
- The flux is dominated by the inner shell, with radius \theta \approx 9 arcsec and filling factor of about 0.5
- So this implies VEM = 2.72 D_kpc^3 pc^3 cm^-6
- Comparing this with the Ha-derived VEM above gives D_kpc =  60.25  / 2.72 = 22.15, which makes no sense!
- But from Frew:2016a it seems that we should be using the full size of the nebula (not sure why this makes sense), which they measure at the 10% isophote and take geometric mean of minor and major
  - This gives 20 and 26 arcsec for diameters, mean of 22.80, but it should be radius, so 11.4
  - So R = 0.0553 D_kpc pc
- Intrinsic flux is 3.7995e-12
  - So surface brightness is S = F / \pi \theta^2 = 9.31e-15 flux/arcsec^2 or *3.96e-04 erg cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1*
  - log10 S = -3.40
  - For optically thin nebulae, the relation should be
    - log SHα = −3.75(±0.11) log r− 5.73(±0.07).
    - with a dispersion of 20% in distance
    - => log R = (-3.40 + 5.73) / −3.75 = -0.62 +/- 0.03
    - R = 0.24 pc
    - => D_kpc = 4.34
  - D = 4.34 +/- 0.30 kpc
- This is good, but better to use the more recent statistical distance scales (see below), and then we can compare [S II] density with rms density
** RMS density
- n_rms = sqrt(VEM / V)
  - sqrt((49.9210 +/- 19.7051) cm^-6 / 4.7731e-07 \theta^3 D_kpc)
  - (1.0 +/- 0.2) 1e4 / sqrt(\theta^3 D_kpc)
  - Arguably, the filling factor f should also go in that sqrt 
  - With long distance scale
    - n = 122.5 pcc
    - remarkably close to the [S II] value, but this is assuming no filling factor

  - \mu = sqrt(2.266e-6 D_kpc^5 \theta^3 F_5)
- For Ou 5
  - D = 4.5 if we accept long scale
  - \theta = 11.4
  - F_5 = 3.2 +/- 0.4
  - \mu = sqrt(2.266e-6 4.5**5 11.4**3 (3.2 +/- 0.4)) = 4.4524 +/- 0.2783

    - This is what I used above with the electron density method
    - The general result is
      : log SHα = γ log r + δ.
      - For the general population they find \gamma = -3.63 ± 0.06,  \delta = -5.32 ± 0.05
        - This is the result from Table 12. There is a slight inconsistency with equation 17 in the text, which has \delta = -5.34 ± 0.05. There is also a sign error in \delta in equation 16
          if we take the negative \delta values from the table
        - log R = (1/\gamma) log SHα - (\delta / \gamma) = (-0.2776 +/- 0.0046) log SHα - (1.4656 +/- 0.0279)

          - log R = (-0.2776 +/- 0.0046) -3.40 - (1.4656 +/- 0.0279) = -0.5218 +/- 0.0320
          - R = 0.3007 +/- 0.0222 pc
      - For the optically thin nebulae they find \gamma = -3.75 ± 0.11, \delta = -5.73 ± 0.07
        - log R = (-0.2667 +/- 0.0078) log SHα - (1.528 +/- 0.0486)

        - log R = -0.6889 +/- 0.0834
          - Note that the error given here is overestimated since it is calculated assuming the error in the intercept and slope are uncorrelated, whereas they are actually highly correlated. Better to use the dispersion in the radii about the mean relation of 0.06
        - R = 0.2047 +/- 0.0393
    - Finds correction to the Frew 2016 distance scale (FPB) of
      : ⟨K_FPB⟩= ⟨D_FPB ×ϖc⟩ = 1.272
      - I think this means that the FPB distances are overestimated by 1.272
    - They also find a secondary dependence on the ionized mass
      - This is similar to the separate trends found by FPB for optically thin and optically thick nebulae
      - Their Fig 3 shows this.
      - Taking this into account for *Ou 5*, we can take the result for M_i \approx 0.1 M_suns
      - For log S(H\beta) = -14.5 this is log R = -0.79 approximately
        - This is about 0.1 dex smaller than the mean, which is the same as the offset from the mean of the optically thin nebulae in Frew
      - R = (0.162  +/- 0.0187) pc
  - Hernandez-Juarez 2024
    - They actually have our nebula in their catalog
      : PN G DZ95 DFBP16 DSH18 DB 1/p δp/p Dtw Case

    - So it has a naive parallax distance of 40 kpc, but that is obviously nonsense
    - It also has \delta p / p bigger than unity, so clearly the parallax is not reliable
  - Ali et al 2022
    - Uses Gaia DR3 to calibrate a Tb-R relation (same as surface brightness but for radio)
    - They go all the way to providing the distance equation
      : 1og(D) = 1.3817 - 0.465 log 0 - 0.268 l0g F5GHz•
      With no error bars on any of the coefficients!
    - If we use that as is we get
      - 1og(D) = 1.3817 - 0.465 log10(11.4) - 0.268 log10(3.2 +/- 0.4) = 0.7549 +/- 0.0145
      - D = 10**(0.7549 +/- 0.0145) = 5.8722 +/- 0.1899
      - Much further away!!
    - But we really should do the offset for the low ionized mass of 0.1 dex in R, so we need to transform this relation to the (log R, log T_b) plane
      - R in pc, \theta in arcsec, D in kpc
      - log R = log D + log \theta + log (1000 au / pc)
      - *log R - log D - log \theta relation*
        - log R = log D + log \theta - 2.3144
      - log R = 1.3817 - 0.465 log \theta - 0.268 (log T_b + 2 log \theta - 1.2463) + log \theta - 2.3144
        - Note that the log \theta terms cancel completely (to a 0.001 precision), as expected
      - *AAMA22 log R - log T_b relation*
        - log R = -0.268 log T_b - 0.5987
        - This is consistent with the graph in Figure 4 of Ali paper
      - Note: slope is more similar to FPB16 (-0.2667 +/- 0.0046) than to BS23 (−0.2420 ±0.0042)
      - Check with Ou 5 values:
        - log R = (-0.268) (-0.362410214161) - 0.5987 = -0.5016
        - R = 0.3151 pc
        - D = 206.3 (R / 11.4) = 5.7022 kpc
        - Almost the same as last time, not sure why it is not exactly the same
      - Now apply the -0.1 dex shift
        - log R = -0.5016 - 0.1 = -0.6016
        - R = 0.2503 pc => D = 4.5296 kpc *Final AAMA22 distance*
  - Smith 2015
    - An older paper (pre Gaia), but seems more sophisticated in its statistical analysis than the later ones
    - 

* Radial density structure
- The inner shell is limb brightened
  - From the fits to the spatial profile along slit g, we get 
- But 

* Kinetic temperature from Ha widths
- Given the very similar distribution of the oiii and ha emission, it should be reliable to estimate the kinetic T from the Ha broadening
- We can do this from the gaussian fits along the central slits
- And could also do it for slit a, which has the narrowest widths because it is tangent to the barrel

* Velocity splitting measurements

* He II emission
+ We have lots of observations of the He II 6560 line
+ We could compare this with the Ha emission to get the ratio of ionizing photons in the two continua
+ But the trouble with that is that it is not clear if the H+ continuum is optically thick.
  + The [N II] emission is very weak, suggesting it might be thin
+ Alternatively, we could just find a He++ Zanstra temperature
  + How does that work exactly?
  + It requires knowledge of the continuum flux from the star at some reference wavelength, which we cannot do easily in this case because it is a binary
  + We would have to extract it from the light curve somehow, and this will be difficult since most of the flux comes from the cool component I think



* Co-added spectra
+ We can add together all the slits that are close to the axis of the nebula, in order to get better signal-to-noise
+ This should work fine, since we have very little variation across the minor axis
