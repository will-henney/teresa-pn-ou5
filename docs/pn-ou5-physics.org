The Q numbers are from original list
** Cloudy models technical
- [ ] Q2. Variable-metallicity modelling: contrast your 1D depth-dependent (radial) scheme with past globule/angle-varying approaches.
- [ ] Q4. Constant-pressure Cloudy models: cool-phase n_e \lesssim 250~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}, warm phase much lower—needed to match Hα flux.
- [ ] Q9. Hierarchy of models: single-T → two-phase → Cloudy; even Cloudy is an approximation to reality.
- [ ] Q10. Cloudy dust note: current ISM dust recipe may be unrealistic; models show dust heating largest in low-Z warm phase (GrnP ≈10–40%) and small in high-Z cool phase (<3%); if Z_{\mathrm{grain}}\!\propto\! Z, dust heating becomes significant for Z=60 cases.
- [ ] Q11. Do a two-phase “equivalent” analysis of the Cloudy grids to compare directly with your plot of cool-phase T vs cool-phase emission fraction.
- [ ] Q17. Cloudy models are more constrained than two-phase: Eq. 10 enforces half the volume above/below \tfrac12(Z_0+1); with j_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}(T) this fixes a relation between cool-phase Hα fraction and cool-phase T. You can derive it analytically and show the curve (Fig. 17).  
** Two phase in general
- [ ] Q1. O⁺/O²⁺ ratio appears the same in cool and warm phases; paradox given higher recombination in the cool, constant-pressure phase.
- [ ] Q6. Metallicity fluctuations are supported not only by ORLs; CEL observations also inconsistent with homogeneous abundances (per Cloudy).
- [ ] Q7. Start discussion with the spatial scale of abundance fluctuations; too small → turbulent diffusion smears them out.
- [ ] Q8. Many PN small-scale structures trace neutral/molecular gas with ionization fronts (denser component).
- [ ] Q16. Cite your earlier work with Grażyna Stajnicka on solid-body destruction; link the part on turbulent dissipation of metallicity (“homogenators”) to current fluctuation arguments.

** TODO Physical params
- [ ] Q5. Put Ou 5’s ionized mass in context of PN population; test the “very low-mass” claim.
- [ ] Q13. Retrieve Bertolami tracks to find initial mass giving evolutionary age consistent with the kinematic age.
- [ ] Q12. Contrast Ou 5’s relatively simple kinematics with NGC 6210 (Turtle): multiple ejections (~5 axes) over ~5000 yr → diversity of PNe.
- [ ] Q18. Discuss implications of your higher L and T_{\mathrm{eff}} for the central star: contrary to Jones et al. post-RGB inference, your values favor a post-AGB status.
- [ ] Q19. Check N/O and C/O for enrichment signatures.
- [ ] Q20. Explore processes that could raise overall metallicity while keeping C/O and N/O near solar.
         
** Other objects
- [ ] Q3. Abell 30 comparison: born-again (likely LTP); inner high-Z knots much younger (~1000 yr); He enhanced; similar T_{\mathrm{eff}} to Ou 5 but [WC]–PG 1159 type; may be binary; unlike Ou 5 where components share similar kinematic ages.

** TODO Earlier sections
- [X] Q14. Section 5 note: explain BB vs Rauch atmospheres—Zanstra used BB; Rauch (for given L and T_{\mathrm{eff}}) has lower optical and He II-ionizing flux, so Cloudy fits need slightly higher T_{\mathrm{eff}} and L to match 4686/Hβ.
- [X] Q15. Section 5 note: add how Hβ + He II λ4686 + optical continuum yield \eta, the fraction of H-ionizing photons absorbed.

  



* ACF versus ADF and omega and cool mass fraction
- The ACF and the ADF are related by ACF / ADF = (1 - \omega) / \omega
  - Gomez-Llanos:2020a, Garcia-Rojas:2022a
- For Ou 5 we have \omega \sim 0.5 so this correction is unity
- But for other nebulae, \omega tends to be small so the correction is larger
- Garcia-Rojas:2022a give ACF and ADF values, but do not give \omega directly
  - So we will have to invert the equations to find it
  - \omega  = 1 / [1 + (ACF / ADF)]
- *Conclusion*
  - The lower ADF nebulae (ADF = 9-10) have small \omega < 0.1
  - Hf 2-2 has ADF = 18 and has a larger \omega
  -

** Cool mass fraction
- Castañeda-Carlos:2025a prefer to talk of the mass fraction in the cool component, so let's deal with that
- They find mass fraction \mu = 0.18, we want to find emission fraction \omega
- Assume two components, cool and warm: k = {c, w}
- Recomb line emission from component k: L_k = VEM_k h\nu \alpha_eff(T_k) = V_k n_k^2 h\nu \alpha_eff(T_k)
  - Assume \alpha_eff(T_k) = \alpha' T_k^-\beta
- Mass of component k: M_k = m n_k V_k
- Mass fraction: \mu = M_c / (M_c + M_w)
- Emission fraction: \omega = L_c / (L_c + L_w)
- Volume fraction: \xi = V_c / (V_c + V_w)
  - V_c = \xi V
  - V_w = (1 - \xi) V
- M_c = m n_c V_c = \xi m n_c V
- M_w = m n_w V_w = (1 - \xi) m n_w V
- \mu =  \xi m n_c V / [ \xi m n_c V + (1 - \xi) m n_w V]
  - \mu = \xi (n_c/n_w) / [ \xi (n_c/n_w) + 1 - \xi]
    - Define \delta = n_c/n_w
  - \mu = \delta / [\delta + \xi^-1 - 1]
  - \mu = \xi \delta / [1 + \xi (\delta - 1)]
- Inverse relation
  - \xi = 1 / [1 + \delta (\mu^-1 - 1)] = \mu / [(1 - \delta) \mu + \delta]
  - \xi = \mu / [\mu + \delta (1 - \mu)]
- L_c = V_c n_c^2 h\nu \alpha' T_c^-\beta = M_c n_c T_c^-\beta (h\nu \alpha' / m) = \mu n_c T_c^-\beta (h\nu \alpha' M / m)
- L_w = (1 - \mu) n_w T_w^-\beta (h\nu \alpha' M / m)
- \omega = \mu n_c T_c^-\beta / [\mu n_c T_c^-\beta + (1 - \mu) n_w T_w^-\beta]
  - Define t = T_c/T_w
  - \omega = \mu \delta t^-\beta / [\mu \delta t^-\beta + 1 - \mu]
  - \omega = \mu \delta t^-\beta / [1 + \mu (\delta t^-\beta - 1)]
- Final equation relating mass fraction and emission fraction:
  - \omega = A \mu /[1 + (A-1) \mu]
  - Where A = (n_c/n_w) (T_c/T_w)^-\beta
- Put in some numbers for Hf 2-2
  - n_w = 500 - 2000 pcc; n_c = 3000 - 5000 pcc
    - \delta = vmeane([3000, 5000]) / vmeane([500, 2000]) = 3.2 +/- 2.08
  - T_w = 8000 - 16000 K; T_c = 540 K
    - t = 540 / vmeane([8000, 16000]) = 0.045 +/- 0.015
  - \beta = 0.75 (roughly)
  - A = \delta t^-\beta = (3.2 +/- 2.08) (0.045 +/- 0.015)**-0.75 = 33 +/- 23
- So \omega = 33 0.18 / (1 + 32 0.18) = 0.88
  - Or with mean - sigma: (33 - 23) 0.18 / (1 + (32 - 23) 0.18) = 0.69
  - Or with mean + sigma: (33 + 23) 0.18 / (1 + (32 + 23) 0.18) = 0.92
- *Conclusion: \omega > 0.7*
- We can also work out the volume fraction: \xi = 0.18 / (0.18 + 33 (1 - 0.18)) = 0.0066
  - Or with mean - sigma: 0.18 / (0.18 + (33 - 23) (1 - 0.18)) = 0.021
  
* Instrumental widths
| Line: Slit  |    lam | d lam |   d v | sigma |
|-------------+--------+-------+-------+-------|
| Ha : 150    | 6562.8 |  0.26 | 11.89 |  5.05 |
| o iii : 150 | 5006.8 |  0.19 | 11.38 |  4.83 |
| Ha : 70     | 6562.8 |  0.13 |  5.94 |  2.52 |
#+TBLFM: $4=3e5 $3 / $2 ; f2::$5=$4 / sqrt(8 log(2));f2

- But supposedly, it is 11.76 km/s at Ha
  - which would give
    - 11.76 6563 / 3e5 = 0.257 at Ha
    - 11.76 5007 / 3e5 = 0.196 at [O III]
    - 
** Crazy idea for estimating the instrumental widths better
- The narrowest line that I have in the data is the ISM [N II] component
- We could measure its width with the 150 micron and 70 micron slit
- Then we could plot \sigma^2 against slit-width^2
  - The intercept at zero slit width should give the intrinsic sigma of the line
  - The sqrt of the slope should give the instrumental sigma versus slit width
  - This is assuming that the "optical" instrumental width is small, and all is due to the finite slit width
    - Meaburn says that resolution is at least 30 microns, so that seems a reasonable approximation
** We could also measure the H temperature of the ISM
Using the linewidth method with Ha and [N II]

** 

* Cloudy models
- These are toy models, so should not be expected to reproduce all observables
- But they are still useful as a guide to what might work and what clearly does not
-


** Final steps to finish Cloudy model analysis
1. [X] Run models
   - [X] EOS variants
     - [X] constant density
     - [X] constant pressure (perhaps not necessary)
   - Z fluctuation amplitude: 0, 6, 15, 30, 60
   - Z fluctuation wavelength:
     - short: 0.2 (r_out - r_in)
     - long: 2 (r_out - r_in)
2. [X] Make structure and emissivity plots
   - [X] This is done in 05-02-cloudy-models.ipynb
   - [X] Plot is of 3 models at a time
   - [X] I need to tidy up the way of specifying the Z fluctuation variants
     - Now done using ~enum.StrEnum~ 
3. [-] Extract global quantities for each models
   - [X] Ha luminosity, line ratios, weighted temperatures, and t^2
   - [X] First version from grepping in the .out files
     - See tables in [[id:3D2FEE9E-5C10-4FAD-8AE9-E84BFC9BEDB7][ou5a-T115-L660-n-lha: constant density tied to L(Ha)=33.86]]
     - [X] This works fine, but Ha-emission-weighted temperatures is not obtainable from .out, so copied it over from the jupyter notebook
     - [X] Get the ionized mass too
   - [-] Second version using the radial structure from .ems, .ovr, etc
     - Is this really necessary?
     - [X] Small python script that generalises the "Calculate Ha-weighted temperature" section of [[file:../notebooks/05-02-cloudy-models.ipynb]]
       - Extract total line luminosity of all the emission lines in .ems
       - Plus the emission-weighted temperature and electron density for each line
       - Write YAML file for each model with the results
     - [X] Use YAML files from previous step to make table of line ratios (and other quantities) versus model
     - [-] In the "other" category, we can include the Peimbert O++ T and t^2 values derived from 4363, 5007, 4651
4. [X] Make plot and/or latex table of selected global quantities
   - [X] Done line ratios
   - [X] Maybe do some temperatures as well
5. Understand what is going on in the plots better
   - I have added a panel of O++/O fraction to the physical variables plot, which helps a lot
     - For constant density models, O++/O rises in cool high-Z peaks in the inner half of the shell
       - In the outer half of the shell O++/O is unity in both phases
       - Despite this, the [O III] emissivity and the [O III]/Hb ratio peak in the warm phase
6. [X] Write description for paper


** Metal recomb lines
- Cloudy does not include these in the full line calculations (using STOUT data)
- Instead it has a set of analytic fits from various sources.
  - Often these are for the full multiplet instead of individual components
  - 
- Particular cases
  - O II multiplet V1
    - ~O  2 4651.00A~ is type: r, recombination line
      - Is this just the two components though? or the whole multiplet
    - ~O 2R 4651.00A~ is type: t, total recombination, 4638.86-4696.35 (8 lines)
    - ~O  2 4649.13A~ is one component: 3s 4P5/2  -- 3p 4D*7/2
    - ~O  2 4650.84A~ is another component: 3s 4P1/2 -- 3p 4D*1/2

*** How Cloudy deals with the recomb line data
- Data is stored in ~data/rec_lines.dat~
- The data comes from two sources:
  1. Pequignot:1991a (article)
     - Total and effective radiative recombination coefficients
     - D. {Pequignot}, P. {Petitjean}, and C. {Boisson}
     - \aap, 251:680-688, November 1991
     - Total and effective radiative recombination coefficients for all H, He, C, N, O, Ne ions are computed and presented for important optical and UV transitions of these ions. The coefficients are shown in the form of simple fits, accurate in the full range of temperatures applicable to cold plasmas which are believed to develop in low-density gases enriched in heavy elements.
  2. Nussbaumer:1984a (article)
     - Dielectronic recombination at low temperatures. II Recombination coefficients for lines of C, N, O
     - H. {Nussbaumer} and P. J. {Storey}
     - \aaps, 56:293-312, June 1984
     - Effective dielectronic recombination coefficients are calculated for selected lines and ground and metastable terms of ions of C, N and O. Those ions are treated for which the recombining ion has n = 2 valence electrons. The effective recombination coefficients are fitted to a convenient function of temperature in the range 103 to 6×104K. Astrophysical applications are discussed.

*** Contrast with pyNeb
- pyNeb uses Storey:2017a, which uses the resolved levels of the multiplets
- E.g., V1 multiplet
  - 4638.86
  - 4641.81
  - 4649.13
  - 4650.84
  - 4661.63
  - 4673.73
  - 4676.23

*** Density and temperature diagnostics from O II lines
- Storey:2017a Fig 7 is a good summary
- Also see Fig 6 of Fang:2013a, which has V1 multiplet relative intensities for different temperatures
- 4089/4649 is T-sensitive
  - Unfortunately, V 48a 4089 is not detected in Ou 5
    - Based on the given percentage uncertainties, we have a consistent sigma = 0.43 for the relative flux uncertainties
    - So 3-sigma upper limit is 3 0.43 = 1.3
    - Implying
      - 4089/4649 \lt 0.341
      - Or 4649/4089 > 2.9
    - Fang:2013a Fig 17 have it the other way up: 4649/4089
      - We have 4649/4089 > 2.9, which log T > 3.5 from Fang
      - Also Storey:2017a Fig 7 has 4649/4089 > 2.9 being log T > 3.4
      - Sanity check: Abell 46 has 4089/4649 = 1.16 (1 +/- 0.15) / 3.14 (1 +/- 0.06) = 0.37 +/- 0.06
        - So 4649/4089 = 2.7 +/- 0.4
        - That does indeed imply lower T: 2.8 to 3.6 in log
      - But we should definitely test this in pyneb
  - Other T-sensitive ratios
    - V15 4591 / V 1 4649: Fang Fig 21a (but inverted)
      - Ou 5 has 4649 / 4591 > 2.9 too => log T < 4
- 4649/4661 is n-sensitive
  - See Fang:2013a Fig 18 for curves at different T
  - 4649/4651 is very similar
  - In Ou 5 we have 3.81 (1 +/- 0.12) / 1.89 (1 +/- 0.23) = 2.0 +/- 0.5
    - At T = 1e4 then 4649/4651 = [1.5, 2.0, 2.5] => log n = [3.1, 3.35, 3.6]
    - At T = 1e3 then 4649/4651 = [1.5, 2.0, 2.5] => log n = [2.4, 3.05, 3.25]
      
 

** DONE Adjusting the abundances
CLOSED: [2025-09-12 Fri 21:41]
- We should use the empirically determined abundances to set everything for the Cloudy models
  - At least for the warm phase with the CEL abundances
    - Although we need to take into account the 1 - \omega factor
  - The ORL abundances will be weighted towards the higher abundance regions in the varying metallicity models
- Anyway, first job is to grab the empirical abundances from the Corradi:2015a paper


*** Corradi abundance table (mainly from their Table 8)
#+tblname: ou5_abund_corrected
| Element | 12+log(X/H)        |
|---------+--------------------|
| He      | 11.29 ± 0.05       |
| C       | 8.09 ± 0.10        |
| N       | 7.58 ± 0.05        |
| O       | 8.40 ± 0.05        |
| Ne      | 7.96 ± 0.05        |
| S       | 6.81 ± 0.07        |
| Ar      | 6.29 ± 0.05        |
| Cl      | 5.20 (+0.17/−0.20) |

The C abundance was not in the table, so I did it like this (helped a bit by ChatGPT):

- He, N, O, Ne, S, Ar, Cl are the Ou 5 “Corrected” totals from Corradi et al. Table 8.
  - Values and uncertainties match the table (including asymmetric errors for Cl).
- For C/H, I used the ORL C/O from Table 7 and combined it with the CEL total O/H from Table 8:
  - C/O(ORL) = (C²⁺/O²⁺)_ORL = 10^(9.70−10.01) = 0.49.
    - (From Corradi Table 7 Ou 5: C²⁺(ORL)=9.70±0.05; O²⁺(ORL)=10.01±0.08.)  
  - O/H(CEL,total) = 8.40±0.05 (Corradi Table 8)'
  - ⇒ C/H(warm) = (C/O)_ORL × (O/H)_CEL = 8.09 dex.
  - Uncertainty: σ[log(C/O)] = √(0.05²+0.08²)=0.09 dex;
    - combine with σ[O/H]=0.05 dex → σ ≃ 0.10 dex.
  - Using ω from ORL O⁺ and O²⁺ (Table 7) gives ω≈0.90–0.95, so the Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014) ICF for C²⁺ is ≈1; adopting it leaves C/H unchanged within 0.01 dex.
    - (ICFs based on ω become ~unity as ω→1.)

- So O/H is 0.5 solar
- He/H is 2 times solar
- N/O is solar (0.15)
- C/O is solar (0.5)

** Constant pressure models
- These are tricky to get right, since we want the average density to be, say, 150 pcc, but we need to specify conditions at the illuminated face
- Solution is to use the ~constant pressure set XXX~ command, where XXX is the desired n T pressure at the illuminated face
- If we want to have n_e = 150, and mean temperature of 6000 K, then we have n T \approx 1e6
- Exact value depend on if it is H density or total particle density
- Seems need to multiply by 2 at least
- This turns out to be best dealt with by normalizing to the observed Ha flux, see next section
** Models with "no induced processes"
- Checking to see if there are any fluorescence effects. I think not
- I have also set drmin 14.5 on the short models to speed things up

** Normalization to the H line luminosity
- From the extinction-corrected H alpha flux of 3.8e-12 (1 +/- 0.23) erg/s/cm2, then we can calculate the line luminosity to constrain the models:
  - L = (4 pi D**2) F = (4 pi 4000**2 3.085677582e18**2) 3.8e-12  = 7.3e+33 erg/s
  - log L = log10(7.3e+33 (1 +/- 0.23) ) = 33.86 +/- 0.10
- Although, we need to think about what fraction of the flux comes from the inner shell
  - Down in [[id:C4243082-6644-4620-9FF4-044C41BF7660][Summary table of the components]] we find 74%: log10(0.74) = -0.1308
- But we also want to *divide* by the area covering fraction, which is around 0.8, so these will cancel out
  - *conclusion* best leave it as it was
- *But again* [2025-09-09 Tue 07:14] The He II / H I is coming out too low in these models, so we will do the 0.74 factor and also take the -0.1 dex 1 sigma error
  - Use prefix ~-llha~ for these:
    - low L(Ha) with target of log10(L(Ha)) = 33.86 - 0.1 - 0.1308 = 33.6292
  - Assuming n ~ sqrt(L) then dex offset is 0.5 (log10(0.74) - 0.1) = -0.1154
  - Or factor of 10**-0.1154 = 0.7667
*** DONE Repeat for the new abundance set
CLOSED: [2025-09-12 Fri 22:31]
- We are getting lower luminosties now, possibly because of the increased temperature
- I also want to try out higher amplitude abundance fluctuations
  - We are now doing 6 and 30 for the amplitude
- We will go back to the n140 models to start with
- This is now complete for the constant density models
  - I am not sure if it is worth doing the constant pressure ones

**** DONE [6/6] ou5a-T115-L660-n-llha: constant density tied to LOWER L(Ha)=33.63
CLOSED: [2025-09-15 Mon 12:29]
- We want to bump up the He II 4686/Hb ratio to 0.7 (currently 0.4)
- Another justification for lower luminosity is that the extinction might be lower if the low T are true
  - (see Table 3 of Corradi:2015a that gives c(Hb) = 0.94 for T = 12500 K, but 0.77 for T = 1000K)
- Reduction in luminosity is by 10**(33.86 - 33.63) = 1.7
- So reduction in density is by sqrt(1.7) = 1.3
- That is what we do in the next table. The last column is the calculated lower density that we need to put in the *-n-llha.in files

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2025-09-28 Sun 18:50] \\
  So the conclusion is that the lower luminosity can help with increasing the [N II] and [O II] but only at the cost of reducing the He II
- Note taken on [2025-09-28 Sun 18:36] \\
  Add the low stellar luminosity models
- Note taken on [2025-09-21 Sun 09:16] \\
  This is something I really need to mention in the paper, since it is a serious discrepancy between the models and the observations
:END:

Extract them from the .res file, except they need to be divided by H beta

- Results:
  - [O II] 3726 / H beta = 0.11 homogeneous
    - 0.02 (Z_0 = 15), 0.003 (Z_0 = 60)
    - L400 gives 0.23 (0.03, 0.004)
    - Observed: 0.26
  - [N II] 6583 / H beta = 0.03 homogeneous
    - 0.007 (Z_0 = 15), 0.0005 (Z_0 = 60)
    - L400 gives 0.08 (0.015, 0.0015)
    - Observed: 0.15
- Conclusions:
  - We totally fail to reproduce these ratios

**** Check that the adjustments have worked
- They should all have 33.86 +/- 0.1
- First iteration
  - They all worked except the constant pressure, constant metallicity one
    | ou5-T115-L660-p-lha.out | 6562.80A | 34.198 |
  - Not a surprise, since the luminosity was nearly 2 orders of magnitude too low originally
  - This is because the T has come down a bit from the 20,000 K we had before
- So iterate again
  - 6.98 - 0.5 (34.198 - 33.86) = 6.81

#+TBLFM: $11=$-1 - 45.2820

- [[id:089874E1-67F5-455B-BC7C-CC0891434EEA][Below]] we derived primary apparent extinction-corrected magnitude m_g = 17.39 +/- 0.25
  - Giving log \nu f_\nu = -11.59 +/- 0.1
- The ~nuFnu(Bbet)~ is actually luminosity, not flux, so to convert to observed flux we subtract log10(4 pi D**2)
  - log10(4 pi D**2) = log10(4 pi 4000**2 3.085677582e18**2) = 45.2820
  - Now shown in column ~Earth~
- So the BB model fits the visual continuum value perfectly, as expected
  - But the Rauch models are too faint in the visual band *and* too faint beyond 4 Rydbergs
  - For the T=103 model, there is a visual shortfall of 10**(-11.59 - -11.791) = 1.59
  - For the T=115 model, there is a visual shortfall of 10**(-11.59 - -11.9093) = 2.09
- For the ~Q(4.0-20)~ value, the photon counting analysis (notebook 05-01) implies 1.54e45 for 6000 K, whereas the BB model gives 1.8698e45, which is 20% larger
  - Not sure why this discrepancy, but it is within the errors
  - The T=103 Rauch model gives 3.0584e+44, which is 0.2 times what is needed
  - The T=115 Rauch model gives 9.2342e+44, which is 0.6 times what is needed
- So multiplying the Luminosity of the T=115 model by 1.67 would fix things approximately
  - L = 660 Lsun
  - *Yes, that works*. It is correct in ~Q(4.0-20)~ (1.5237e+45) and 0.1 dex too faint in log \nu f_\nu but that is within the errors
  - It also gives 4686/Hb = 0.5 (observed 0.71)
** Stellar spectrum
- We use L = 400 Lsun from the Zanstra analysis
- T = 103 kK works for a black body: Q(4-20) = 2e45 /s but not for the Rauch model atmosphere: Q(4-20) = 3e44

* Stellar evolution
- Using MB2016 tracks and MIST

-
  
** Initial and final masses
- WD mass below 0.53 M⊙ is the cutoff, which is usually taken between 


** Sensitivity to distance
- In order for the horizontal-track stars to work, we need the luminosity to L_* = 10**3.5 = 3000 Lsun
- So this means the distance needs to be bigger by factor of sqrt(3000/400) = 2.74
- So D = 11 kpc, instead of 4 kpc
- If that were the case, then the kinematic times would also be longer: 22,000 years
  - But that would not change things much
*** 1.5 times farther: D = 6 kpc
- t_kin = 12300 yr
- L = 1000 Lsun
- M_f = 0.555 +/- 0.005 with v_rot = 0
*** D = 3 kpc
- t_kin = 6000 yr
- L = 250 L_sun
- M_f = 0.605 \pm 0.005, M_i = 2.4 \pm 0.2
*** D = 5 kpc
- t_kin = 6000
- L = 650
- M_f = 0.57 approx
*** Back to D = 4 kpc with vrot = 0
- M_f = 0.572, M_i = 1.60
** Zero point of AGB
- I am taking Teff = 1e4 K as t=0
- Evolution from 0.5e4 to 2.0e4 takes 400 years for the higher mass models (the ones that fit the dynamic age)

** Escape velocity
- 0.5 v^2 = G M / R
  - v_esc = sqrt(2 G M / R)
- g = G M / R^2
- => v_esc = sqrt(2 g R)

* Stellar parameters
- We can run some models with the Rauch atmosphere for the stellar parameters of the Jones binary solution
- This will tell us various things
  - The Q_3 value can be compared with what we estimate from pyneb
  - And also it can directly give us the emissivity of the He II and H I lines
** Stellar parameters from Jones et al 2022 for hot component
- T_eff = 67.2 (+4.9-4.6) kK = (12.05 +/- 0.85) T_sun
  - T_sun = 5578 K
- Radius = 0.078 \pm 0.006 R_sun
- We can use Stefan Boltzmann to find luminosity
  - L / L_sun = (R / R_sun)**2 (T / T_sun)**4
  - L / L_sun = = (0.078 +/- 0.006)**2 (12.05 +/- 0.85)**4
  - L = 128.3 +/- 41.2
- This is quite a low luminosity for the central star
  - The Zanstra analysis would give 225 +/- 52 L_sun if the distance were 3 kpc, which is marginally consistent with the Jones value
  - Alternatively, rescaling Jones to our distance gives (4/3.1)**2 128.3 +/- 41.2 = 214 +/- 70
    - Compared with 400 +/- 92 for ours
- Mass: 0.50 +/- 0.06
** Stellar parameters from the Zanstra analysis
- See [[id:8E92B83D-BADB-4AC7-B81E-D60E024AE574][Zanstra temperatures]] section below
- Stellar effective temperature from [[id:C23A436C-3609-490C-ABCC-BB16E7E31906][Derived Zanstra temperature]]
  - T = (103 + 4 - 3) kK
- Luminosity from [[id:18442B66-D8CB-4EF4-BB6F-FA979F152B23][Derived luminosity]]
  - L(BB) = (400 +/- 92) L_sun (D / 4 kpc)^2
  - L(Rauch) = 660 L_sun (D / 4 kpc)^2
- Stellar radius from Stefan Boltzmann
  - R / R_sun = sqrt(L / L_sun) / (T / T_sun)**2 = sqrt(400 +/- 92) / (103 +/- 4 / 5.578)**2
  - BB: R / R_sun = 0.059 +/- 0.008
  - Rauch: R / R_sun = sqrt(660) / (103 +/- 4 / 5.578)**2 = 0.0753 +/- 0.0058
  - Rauch with L=400: R / R_sun = sqrt(400) / (103 +/- 4 / 5.578)**2 = 0.0587 +/- 0.0046
  - So our radius is consistent with Jones if we use the Rauch value
- Stellar gravity, assuming M_1 = 0.53 Msun (why? Jones has 0.50 ± 0.06)
  - BB: log g = G M / R^2 = log10(6.673e-8  1.989e33 (0.50 +/- 0.06) / (0.06 6.96e10)**2) = 6.58 +/- 0.05
  - Rauch: log10(6.673e-8 (0.50 +/- 0.06) 1.989e33 / ((0.0753 +/- 0.0058) 6.96e10)**2) = 6.38 +/- 0.08
- Repeat gravity but using M = 0.574 from our fitting
  - Rauch 400: log10(6.673e-8 (0.574 +/- 0.001) 1.989e33 / ((0.0587 +/- 0.0046) 6.96e10)**2) = 6.659 +/- 0.068
  
- Optical depth of Lyman continuum from [[id:B9698DFD-3E25-41CF-B77E-893B44846D71][H beta gives fraction of H-ionizing photons absorbed]]
  - \eta = 0.198 \pm 0.002
** Constraints from visual magnitudes
- The primary eclipse in the g band (which has peak at 4686, so it is bluer than V)
  - \delta g = 3.6, g = 23.3 to 19.7
  - 23.3 must be the secondary magnitude m_2
    - F_2 = 10**(-0.4 23.3) = 4.7863e-10
  - 19.7 must be sum of primary and secondary
    - F_1 + F_2 = 10**(-0.4 19.7) = 1.3183e-08
    - => F_1 = 1.3183e-08 - 4.7863e-10 = 1.270437e-8
    - => m_1 = -2.5 log10(F_1) = 19.74
- Repeat for the r band (peak at 6165)
  - Average of r and g is at 5425.5, which is close to V
  - \delta r = 2.2, r = 21.4 to 19.2
  - F_2 = 10**(-0.4 21.4) = 2.75422870334e-9
  - F_1 + F_2 = 10**(-0.4 19.2) = 2.08929613085e-8
  - F_1 = 2.08929613085e-8 - 2.75422870334e-9 = 1.81387326052e-8
  - m_1 = -2.5 log10(F_1) = 19.35
- So taking the average of the g-band and r-band values, we find an apparent magnitude of
  - m_V = 19.55 for the primary
- *But* we are forgetting extinction. Supposedly, A_V = 2, which we also needs to be subtracted
- So at 4 kpc, we have a distance modulus of 5 log10(4000) - 5 = 13.01
  - M_V = 19.55 - 13.01 - 2 = 4.54
- If we used 3 kpc, then DM = 5 log10(3000) - 5 = 12.3856
  - M_V = 19.55 - 12.39 - 2 = 5.16
- *These can be compared with the Cloudy models*
  - The standard model with T=70,000 K and L=130 L_sun has M_V = 5.2934, so that fits quite well (although it completely fails to fit the He++ continuum)
  - With T=100 kK we get M_V = 6.3,
  - so this is too faint by a factor of 10**(0.4 (6.3 - 4.54) = 5.06

In Jones+(2022) they say

: (WFC) on the nights 21-23 August 2015 and 1-5 August 2016 with

: to the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC; Dhillon et al. 2018).
: Simultaneous exposures of 2.145s were taken in all bands* for a
: duration of approximately 1.5 hours beginning prior to ingress and
: continuing through egress (with approximately 8ms dead time between

and

: HiPERCAM is a five-band imager with "Super SDSS" filters of which we

We will assume we can use the AB magnitude system to convert to fluxes

Supposedly

AB_\nu =-2.5 log f_\nu (ergs s^-1 cm^-2 Hz^-1)  — 48.60,

which is in Fukugita:1996a (this comes from AB = 0 corresponding to 3631 Jy)

=> log f_\nu (ergs s^-1 cm^-2 Hz^-1) = -0.4 AB_\nu - 19.44

For us we have \lambda = 4686 \AA => \nu = c / \lambda = 6.39761967563e14 Hz

So log \nu = 14.8060184187

=> log \nu f_\nu = log \nu + log f_\nu = -0.4 AB_\nu - 19.44 + 14.8060184187 = -0.4 AB_g - 4.6340

If we use the observed m_g = 19.74 and correct it for extinction using c(H\beta) = 0.94 ± 0.10 => A(H\beta) = 2.35 +/- 0.25

c = -log10(F/F_0) = -log10(10^-0.4A) = 0.4 A => A = 2.5 c

So, extinction-corrected m_g = 19.74 - 2.35 = 17.39 +/- 0.25

Which gives log \nu f_\nu = -0.4 (17.39 +/- 0.25) - 4.6340 = -11.59 +/- 0.1

*Hurray, this is very similar to the method below, which gave -11.54*

This way is to be preferred since it is cleaner and can be justified with reference to published equations. And it is all done in a single pass band

Note that the error of +/- 0.1 is dominated by uncertainty in the extinction. But that affects the lines and continuum equally, so it should cancel out when it comes to determining T_eff.

The error in the observed photometry was about 0.05 mag = 0.02 dex

We can use this to calculate the H\beta equivalent width

Continuum \lambda F_\lambda = (2.57 +/- 0.12 +/- 0.59)e-12

F(H\beta) = 3.8e-12 / 3 = 1.2667e-12

Hence W_\lambda = F(H\beta)/F_\lambda = \lambda F(H\beta)/\lambda F_\lambda = 4861 1.2667 / (2.57 +/- 0.12) = 2400 +/- 100

Note that this does not include the atomic nebular continuum, but I am not sure how bright that is.

- Stanghellini+ 2002 cite Stanghellini 1993 who cite Kaler 1983

The idea is to find the stellar temperature for which the luminosity parameter
\[
  \Lambda = (L / L_\odot) (D / \mathrm{kpc})^{-2}
\]
has the same value from two different observations:
- stellar visual magnitude (for which  \Lambda increases as T increases since fraction of luminosity emitted in visual band is falling)
- He II recombination line flux (for which \Lambda decreases as T increases since fraction of luminosity with h\nu > 4 Rydbergs is increasing)

So if L = 100 L_sun at 4 kpc, we have \Lambda = 6.25

Everything is calculated in terms of the stellar temperature T_\star, with \(t = T_* / 10^4 \mathrm{K}\)

They also use a covering factor \xi = \Omega / 4 \pi
*** Star
- They use A(\lambda) = F_line(\lambda) / \lambda F_\lambda,\star = W_\lambda / \lambda
- Continuum Stellar flux
    \[\log ( \nu F_\nu) = -0.4 m_s + 0.14 c - 4.70\]
  Where m_s is the photographic magnitude (centered on 4365)
  - We can calibrate it using cloudy
    - Cloudy gives  ~nuFnu(Bbet):  33.0372~ but that is in luminosity units
    - Put in actual flux at 10 pc to compare with absolute magnitudes
      log10(\nu F_\nu) = log10(10**33.0372 / 4 pi * (10 3.085677582e18)**2) = -7.0407
    - Where ~Abs V mag:   6.3022~
    - So we have log10(\nu F_\nu) = -0.4 m_V - \Delta
      - \Delta = -0.4 6.3022 + 7.0407 = 4.5198
      - *This is very similar to Harman:1966a, hurray!*
    - So we have  \[\log ( \nu F_\nu) = -0.4 m_V - 4.52\]
  - For Ou 5 we have extinction-corrected apparent m_V = 19.55 - 2 = 17.55
    - So log ( \nu F_\nu) = -0.4 17.55 - 4.52 = -11.54
    - In theory it would be better to just use the g band, since this is centered on H\beta region, and to calculate the equivalent flux properly based on the calibration of the magnitude scale
      - This is now done in [[id:089874E1-67F5-455B-BC7C-CC0891434EEA][Absolute flux calibration of the stellar magnitudes]]
      - I get log ( \nu F_\nu) = -11.59 +/- 0.02 +/- 0.1
      - First error is photometry, second includes extinction
- Black body result for luminosity parameter 
  \[
  \Lambda =2.590 \times 10^9 (\nu F_\nu) t^4 (e^{2.96/t} - 1)

*** He II
- Based on the 4686 line
  \[
  \Lambda = 3.64e11 \frac{\mathcal{F}}{\xi} \frac{t}{F_4(t)}
  \]
- where
  - \mathcal{F}(\lambda4686) is the line flux
    - For Ou 5 we have
      - Extinction-corrected Ha flux F(Ha) = 3.8e-12 erg/s/cm2 (1 +/- 0.14 +/- 0.23)
      - 4686/Hb = 0.71 (1 +/- 0.01)
      - Assume Ha/Hb = 3
      - So F(4686) =  0.71 3.8e-12 / 3 = 8.9933e-13 erg/s/cm2 (1 +/- 0.14 +/- 0.23)
      - Where fractional uncertainty is (1 +/- photom +- extinct)
      - Extinction error is from roughly 10% uncertainty in c(Hb)
      - so F(4686) =  (9.0 +/- 1.3 +/- 2.1)e-12
  - F_4(t) is the dimensionless integral of stellar photon spectrum beyond 4 Rydbergs
    - Given by table VI of Harman:1966a
  - Covering fraction \xi
    - \xi = 1 if we assume the He++ continuum is thick in all directions
    - Or if we assume the poles are thin, we can use solid angle of the inner lobes:
      - Take r, z = 5.3, 8 for inner shell top edge
      - So polar opening angle is \theta = arctan(5.3/8) = 33.5245
      - So \xi = cos(33.5245) = 0.8336, which is not so different from unity
      - Assume +/- 10% uncertainty in \xi
- Then we multiply by 0.68 to account for the difference in the Case B fraction of 4686 photons per He++ recombination, which in the notebook 05-01 I calculate to be 0.26 at 6000 K, whereas HS66 assumed 0.18 at 15,000 K

- So it looks like the cross-over occurs around \Lambda = 25, which we will find by linear interpolation on log of ratio:
  - 10 has log r = -0.0757
  - 11 has log r = 0.1959
  - So log r = 0 at t = 10 + 0.0757 / (0.1959 + 0.0757) = 10.2787, say 10.3 
- t = 10 has ratio 0.84 +/- 0.15, so that 1.0667 sigma away from unity
- t = 11 has ratio 1.57 +/- 0.29, so that is 1.9655 sigma away from unity
- This implies an asymmetric error, which if we interpolate linearly gives
  - negative 1 sigma error: (10.2787 - 10)/1.0667 = 0.2613
  - positive 1 sigma error: (11 - 10.2787)/1.9655 = 0.3670
- So final result is T = (103 + 4 - 3) kK

- Doing linear interpolation for \Lambda_* yields 22.9 + 0.2787 (30.1 - 22.9) = 24.9
- Assuming D = 4 kpc, then L = D**2 \Lambda = 16 24.9066 = 399 L_sun
- Uncertainty should now include the systematic extinction uncertainty, so 0.1 dex = 23%
- L = (400 +/- 92) L_sun
- The errors do not include the uncertainty in distance, so they would be 0.5625 times smaller at 3 kpc: 225 +/- 52 L_sun

:END:
- This need not be optically thick, so we have a fraction \eta of the H-ionizing photons being absorbed
- Other than that, it is the same as for He II
- So combining (53) and (54) of Harman:1966a we have
  \eta = (5.89/3.64) [F(Hb)/F(4686)] F_4(t) / F_1(t) 
- From the above table, this yields \eta = 0.198 \pm 0.002
- The errors are very small since the claimed accuracy of [F(Hb)/F(4686)] is 1%
- But there is also uncertainty in the recombination coefficients at different temperatures

- For He++, Corradi 2015 find that the ion fractions for their entire slit are
  - He+ : 0.70
  - He++: 0.30
- We could estimate what the maximum value of He++ is
  - The width of the He II profile is 7/9 times width of Ha (assumed the same as He I), so the interior value of He++/He is 0.3 (9/7) = 0.38
  - We can use the recombination rates to estimate what the ionizing luminosity must be in the He II continuum (h\nu > 4 Ryd)
  - And also check that it is optically thick in midplane
- We can also find the Q_3 value from photon-counting arguments
  - We can assume that the (He II 6560 / Ha ratio) in the horizontal slit is representative of the nebula as a whole
  - Then we can find total He++ recombination rate in the nebula
    - \alpha_6560 E_6560 VEM(He++) = L_6560
    - \alpha_{He++} VEM(He++) = Q_3
    - So Q_3 = \alpha_{He++} L_6560 / \alpha_6560 E_6560
  - Compare with hydrogen case
    - \alpha_6563 E_6563 VEM(H+) = L_6563
    - \alpha_B VEM(H+) < Q_1 because optically thin to H Lyman continuum
  - Which immediately gives us Q_3
** He++ line equivalents in H
- All Wavelengths should be divided by Z^2 = 4
- \lambda4686 -> 18744 = 1.87 micron = Pa \alpha (4-3)
- \lambda6560 -> 26240 = 2.62 micron = Br \beta (6-4)
  - This is actually called the Pickering--Fowler series in He+
  - Where they thought it was from half-integer quantum numbers in H, but Bohr showed it was really He+
** Results on Q_3 from He II lines
- This is studied in the 05-01 notebook
- I use our observations of the 6560 line and also the Corradi (2015) observations of 4686
- Both give very consistent results that Q_3 = 1 to 2e45 for distance of 4 kpc
- If we assume 3 kpc then it will be 0.56 times that

  - Third shell (cone and fishtails)
    - 26 arcsec, but very uncertain
- Heights
  - Both shells have a sharpish outer boundary
  - Inner shell
    - 16 or so    
  - Outer shell
    - 26 or so
    - although co-added spectrum would argue for 32
- Aspect ratios: H / D
  - inner 16 / 10.4 +/- 0.4 = 1.54 +/- 0.06
  - outer 26 / 16.5 = 1.58 with large uncertainty
  - these are amazingly consistent
- Velocity splitting
  - [[id:478343AB-FDFD-4EA9-A338-FFC7B0809E0C][Details given below]]
  - Inner shell
    - 26 km/s
  - Outer shell
    - 37 km/s
  - Third shell
    - 70 km/s
  - D / V
    - Inner: 0.4
    - Outer: 0.43
    - Third: 0.37

  - We can use Fig 9 from the paper to estimate them
    - We want the maximum splitting for each component, where we will determine the latitude \theta
  - Inner shell has variation from 18 to 25,
    - where [red, blue] turning points occur at z heights [3.5, 4.5] to N and [2.5, 3.7] to S
    - |z| => vmeane([3.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3.7]) = 3.6 +/- 0.4
    - Combined with r = vmean([3.3, 7.3]) = 5.3 gives \theta = arctan((3.6 +/- 0.4) / 5.3) = 34 +/- 3

- So we now have evidence that the components near the poles may be slightly older than the structures near the equator
  - Alternatively, they may have suffered deceleration due to interaction with the ISM
  - There is some evidence for this in the deviations from point symmetry in the outer lobes

- This is different from what I measured in the slit G of 8.7
- So I now get arccos(1.1 +/- 0.3 / 10.4 +/- 0.4) = 84 +/- 2
- *Alternative version*
  - From the [[id:DAE29C3F-03B0-47F3-88F1-B5814A08E940][next section]], I get a slightly larger diameter of 13.2 because the above is basically measuring the inner edge
  - This then gives i = arccos(1.1 +/- 0.3 / 13.2 +/- 0.2) = 85 +/- 1
- *Third version* [2025-08-24 Sun]
  - From [[id:CE978E44-FC9A-468F-A401-CF648899096F][New cylindrical shell sizes]] we have  r = vmean([3.3, 7.3]) = 5.3 so D = 10.6
  - arccos(1.1 +/- 0.3 / 10.6) = 84 +/- 2
  - So, we are precisely back where we started!!!
*** Second opinion on inclination from the outer disk
- The Outer Disk is part of the outermost shell, which supposedly has a radius of vmean([15, 18]) = 16.5, so D = 33
- The displacement is measured in the notebook to be 2.5 +/- 0.9 arcsec
- Therefore inclination = arccos(2.5 +/- 0.9 / 33) = 86 +/- 2

*** More sophisticated shell measurements
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       DAE29C3F-03B0-47F3-88F1-B5814A08E940
:END:
- See the notebook [[file:../notebooks/04-01-coadd-slits.py][04-01-coadd-slits]] in section "Minor axis spatial profile"
- I look at fitting gaussians to the brightness profile of a thick cylindrical shell with inner, outer radii r_in, r_out
- Results as follows:
  - Gaussian peak radius is \approx r_in
  - Gaussian fwhm is \approx 1.7 (r_out - r_in)
  - So thickness H = (r_out - r_in) \approx 0.6 FWHM
  - And mean radius = 0.5 (r_out + r_in) \approx PEAK + 0.3 FWHM
- For the inner shell on the equator, I find
  - PEAK = 4.4 arcsec
  - FWHM = 7.4 arcsec
- Implying
  - r_in = 4.4 \pm 0.2
  - H = 3.7
  - r_out = 8.1 \pm 0.2
  - mean r = 6.6
  - mean diameter D = 13.2
- /update [2025-05-20 Tue]/ In the notebook I have r_in, r_out = 4.3, 8.8, which seems more reliable
- *So I need to reconcile this with the above measurements*
  - It means that the diameters I have above are from the peaks, so are the inner surface
    - So we all agree that this is about 9 arcsec on the equator
    - For the velocities, we need to check that the peak of the line profile corresponds to the inner edge

#+TBLFM: @6$2=vmeane(@I..@II);f2
- So 2.6 \pm 0.2 is good enough
- Supposedly, it should be 1.9 arcsec, but that needs to be broadened by the seeing
  - sqrt(1.9**2 + 1.6**2 ) = 2.4839, so that is close enough, especially since the image quality seemed worse in the x direction

** Flux and surface brightness
- Using the ha-imslit-median.fits image, I will try and do a flux calibration, so we can measure the surface brightness in physical units
  - The naive way is just to use the mean surface brightness for the big box and put that equal to the mean surface brightness from the Ha flux
  - But we need to subtract off the contribution of 3 stars (the central star and two others)
- Total flux
  - From a rectangular box that is 20 * 26 arcsec, which corresponds to the 10% peak brightness contour

- *Important correction*
  - In order to capture all the flux from the nebula, we need to use the biggest box possible
    - Assuming the bg subtraction is good enough, there should be little penalty from using a bigger box (except it would include more stars that we would need to subtract)
  - *But* for comparison with the mean surface brightness, we need to use the npix area of the nominal ellipse of semi-axes = 10, 13 arcsec, which gives the 11.4 arcsec nominal radius
  - I have now measured the npix area of this ellipse and get npix = 10209
  - As opposed to the 12998 I was using earlier
  - This means that the reference brightness will be higher, which means that the derived EM will be lower, which is what I want to get the density down a bit

  - Here I subtract the 3 stars from the total to get the net flux, then divide by the number of pixels in the big box to get the mean surface brightness
  - *So the answer is* that 0.5765 value in the FITS image corresponds to the mean surface brightness of

    - Conversion to EM from [[id:BA2B583B-1C70-4223-B5B1-FAFE86721344][Balmer line surface brightness versus emission measure]]
    - T = 13,000 K
      - EM = 5200 pc cm^-6
    - T = 6000 K
      - EM = 2850 pc cm^-6
    - T_5 = 0.43 K
- Inner shell versus outer shell fluxes
  - We can do the same but for a smaller box that only includes the inner shell
  - Use a 18 x 16 box
  - Total flux is 5253.4374
  - Only first two stars fall in this box
    - Net inner flux = 5000.3 = 5000.3089 / 5885.8505 = 0.8495 of total flux
    - Net outer flux = 885  / 5885.8505 = 0.1504 of total flux

:END:
- We can estimate densities from observed emission measures if we assume a geometry
- We will use a distance of 4.0 kpc (uncertainty 0.7 pc or 0.18 relative or 0.08 dex)
  - 1 arcsec = 4000 au / pc = 0.0194 pc
- Inner shell geometry from [[id:DAE29C3F-03B0-47F3-88F1-B5814A08E940][More sophisticated shell measurements]] but with corrections from [[id:CE978E44-FC9A-468F-A401-CF648899096F][New cylindrical shell sizes [2025-08-06 Wed]​]]
  - r_in, r_out = 3.3, 7.3 arcsec
  - height 16 arcsec (-8 to +8)
    - easiest to determine from the kinematics
  - Path lengths through shell
    - On axis 2 (r_out - r_in) = 8.0 arcsec = 0.1552 +/- 0.027936 pc
    - Max value 2 sqrt(r_out^2 - r_in^2) = 13.0 arcsec = 0.2522 +/- 0.045396
  - Volume pi (r_out^2 - r_in^2) H = 1065.6282281 arcsec^3 = 0.00778 pc^3
    - Compare with the equivalent spherical volume using the nominal radius of 11.4 arcsec
    - (4 pi / 3) 11.4**3 = 6206 arcsec^3 = 0.0453 pc^3
    - So volume filling factor = 0.00778/0.0453 = 0.17
- Outer lobes geometry
  - Easiest thing to measure is its height
    - Extends to +18 in N and -16 in S
    - But the central (-8 to +8) section seems missing
    - So height of 34 but with 16 removed
    - *New version* dz = 16
  - Inner radius from peak-peak distance of the ears gives D = 17 +/- 0.2, R = 8.5 +/- 0.1
  - Outer radius will have to come from width
    - In notebook I found that thickness is about 0.6 times fwhm
    - Measurements of outer half-width hm for the ears after masking out stars: 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 1.8
    - H = 2 0.6 vmeane([2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 1.8]) = 2.82 +/- 0.33
  - Therefore, r_in, r_out = 8.5, 11.3
    - *New version* 7.3, 11.3
  - On-axis path length = 8 = 0.1552 +/- 0.027936 pc
  - Ears path length = 17.25 = 0.33465 +/- 0.060237 pc
  - Volume pi (r_out^2 - r_in^2) (H_out - H_in) = (11.3**2 - 7.3**2) 16 pi  = 3740 arcsec^3 = 0.0273 pc^3
- Polar knots geometry
  - Extent along slit is 8 arcsec, so assume sphere of radius 4 arcsec
    - This is consistent with fact that they are still seen in the slit with displacement of +3 arcsec
  - z = 2 4 = 8 +/- 2 arcsec = 0.1552 +/- 0.0388 pc
  - Volume = 2 4 pi 4**3 / 3 = 536 arcsec^3 = 3.9147e-03 pc^3
- Outermost lobes geometry
  - Assume "cones" are the outer part of an ellipse
    - i =  84 +/- 2 so sin i = 0.1045 +/- 0.0347
    - So a/b of ellipse will be about 10
  - Inner radius is about 9 arcsec
  - Outer radius 18 arcsec
  - On-axis path length (infinite height) = 0.3492 +/- 0.062856
  - Question is, what is height?
  - With infinite height, then peak depth d z = sqrt( (18)**2 - 9**2) = 15.5885
    - But at a small angle with a finite height, we are limited to h / sin i = 10 h
    - So this only becomes important when h < 1.5 arcsec, which seems unlikely
  - Simplest assumption is that h is same as thickness, so about 3 arcsec
  - so d z = 16 arcsec = 0.3104 +/- 0.0559 pc
  - Volume pi (r_out^2 - r_in^2) H = ((18)**2 - 9**2) pi 3 = 2290 arcsec^3 = 0.0167 pc^3

- We were assuming Ha emission coefficient of 3.1213e-25 erg cm^3 /s for 13,000 K

- So this calculation says that the inner shell is 74% of the total flux from the nebula
- This is consistent with when I did this using apertures, for which I got 85%
  - Originally I got 71% but I had made two mistakes
    - Partly because the box I was using for the inner shell was 14x14, whereas elsewhere I am assuming r_out = 8.8 and h = 16, so I should use an 18 x 16 box
    - And partly because I was not calculating the reference surface brightness correctly. Now that is fixed by using the number of pixels in the nominal ellipse

*** Discussion of density and ionized mass
- The density in the inner lobes now comes out to be more than twice as large as the density from the [S II] ratio
  - The reason for this is that the volume is now less than the equivalent spherical volume that I was using earlier

- From Corradi:2014j we have the observed total H alpha flux of the nebula
  - F(Hα)= 8.5e-13 erg cm-2 s-1
  - They give no uncertainty on this, but we can assume that it is similar to the uncertainty in the radio flux, which is +/- 14%
- And radio flux
  - 3.6 ± 0.5 mJy at 1.4 GHz.
    - Conversion to 5 GHz should be as F \propto \nu^-0.1
    - So F_5 = 3.2 +/- 0.4 mJy 
  - We can relate the radio surface brightness: I = F / \pi \theta^2 to the brightness temperature in the Rayleigh Jeans limit
    - T_b = (c^2 / 2 \nu^2 k) I_\nu
    - 1 Jy = 1e-23 erg /s /cm^2 / Hz
    - From below we are estimating \theta = 11.4 arcsec, so \Omega = \pi \theta^2 = 408.3 sq arcsec = 9.5964e-09 sr
    - At 5GHz, we have  (c^2 / 2 \nu^2 k) = 1.3019e+17
    - So T = 1.3019e+17 (3.2 +/- 0.4) 1e-3 1e-23 / 9.5964e-09 = 0.4341 +/- 0.0543 K
  - General relation T_b = (c^2 / 2 \nu^2 k) F_5 mJy / \pi \theta^2 (1/206265)**2
    - T_b = 17.6311 F_5 / \theta^2
    - *log T_b - log F_5 - log \theta relation*
      - log T_b = 1.2463 + log F_5 - 2 log \theta
      - log F_5 = log T_b + 2 log \theta - 1.2463
  - Supposedly
    F(Hα) = 1.73e-10 erg cm−2 s−1 (S_{1.4} / mJy)
  - I do not think this is right. It should be about 1e-12
- This means that the intrinsic Ha flux is
  - 1e-12 3.6 = 3.6e-12 = 4.2 times observed flux
- So c(H a) = log10(4.2) = 0.62
- Relation between c(Ha) and c(Hb)
  - Frew cites the Howarth (1983) reddening law
  - For the Galaxy this is
    : X(x)= R + 2.56 (x-1.83)-0.993 (x-1.83)2
    - where X is A_\lambda/E(B-V) and x = 1 micron / \lambda

  - This implies c(Ha) / c(Hb) = 1.07/1.58 = 0.68
- So c(H b) = 0.62 /0.68 = 0.912
  - whereas the paper says 1.23 +/- 0.3 for c(H b) derived in this way
  - perhaps because they are using the T = 13 kK, which will reduce the conversion factor a bit
  - From the Balmer lines they find c(Hb) = 0.95 ± 0.25 assuming R_V = 3.1
    - so intrinsic / observed Ha flux is 10**(0.68 (0.95 ± 0.25) ) = 4.4259 +/- 1.7325
    - so intrinsic flux is 8.5e−13 (4.4259 +/- 1.7325) = (3.8 +/- 1.5)e-12  erg cm−2 s−1
    - so that is a 40% uncertainty in the flux, which is mainly due to uncertainty in the reddening correction
- Ha luminosity = 4 pi D^2 F = (4.5467e+32 +/- 1.7947e+32) D_kpc^2 erg/s = 0.1435 D_kpc^2 L_sun
- Conversion to VEM
  - H alpha emissivity = \epsilon = 4 pi j / n_e n_p = 3.1e-25 erg cm^3 / s
  - VEM = \int n_e n_p d V = L / \epsilon = (1.4667 +/- 0.5789) 1e57 D_kpc^2 cm^-3 = (49.9210 +/- 19.7051) D_kpc^2 pc^3 cm^-6

* Return to emission measure versus radio and optical surface brightness

- First do H alpha version in units per steradian
- Osterbrock has emission coefficient (4 \pi j / n_e n_p) = 2.87 1.24e-25 erg cm^3 /s at 1e4 K = 3.5588e-25 erg cm^3 /s
  - Alternative derivation: emission coefficient = \alpha_Ha E_Ha
  - E_Ha = h c / 6563 ang = 6.62606876e-27 2.99792458e10 / 6563 1e-8 = 3.0267e-12 erg
  - \alpha_Ha = 2.87 (6563/4861) 3.03e-14 = 1.1741e-13
  - => emission coefficient = 3.5536e-25 at 1e4, which is the same
    - Pyneb has 3.534e-4
- T dependence is roughly T^-0.5, so at 13,000 K this is 3.1213e-25 erg cm^3 /s
  - Pyneb has 2.75e-25 at 13,000 K
  - Pyneb has 5.65e-25 at 6000 K
- S(Ha) = \int j d z =  (4 \pi j / n_e n_p) \int n_e n_p dz / 4 \pi
- /Old version/ S(Ha) = 3.1213e-25 EM pc / 4 \pi = 7.6644e-8 EM erg /cm^2 /s /sr
- *Corrected to T=6000 K* S(Ha) = 5.65e-25 EM pc / 4 \pi = 1.3874e-07 EM erg /cm^2 /s /sr
- Now convert to H beta and to square arcsec
- S(Hb) = S(Ha) / 2.87 (206265)**2 = 1.1362e-18 EM erg /cm^2 /s /arcsec^2
- Check for Ou 5
  - S(Ha) = 3.9598e-04 erg /cm^2 /s /sr => 2854.1 pc cm^-6
    - Previously I had EM = 5166.5 pc cm^-6
  - S(Hb) = 3.1024e-15 erg /cm^2 /s /arcsec^2 => EM = 2730.5  pc cm^-6
  - These are not quite the same because S(Hb) was calculated assuming a Balmer decrement of 3 instead of 2.87 
** Radio-to-optical conversion factors
- Combining the previous two sections, we can put the Balmer line surface brightness in terms of the radio brightness temperature at 5GHz
- T_b / K = 1.1970e-04 EM
- S(Ha) / (erg /cm^2 /s /sr) = 7.6644e-8 EM = 6.4030e-04 (T_b / K)
  - log T_b = 0 is log S(Ha) = -3.1936
- S(Hb) / (erg /cm^2 /s /arcsec^2) = 6.2769e-19 EM = 5.2439e-15 (T_b / K)
** Compare the distance scales
- I will look at a brightness temperature of 1 K, which is more or less in the middle of all the PN samples, and compare what the different methods predict for the nebula radius
*** Frew 2016
- Principal scale is S(Ha), so 1 K corresponds to 6.4e-4 erg /cm^2 /s /sr
  - log S = -3.19
- From the full sample they have log S = −3.63(±0.06) log r− 5.34(±0.05)
  - log R = (-3.19 + 5.34) / −3.63 = -0.5923
- R = 10**-0.5923 = 0.2557 pc
*** Bucciarelli & Stanghellini 2023
- Scale is S(Hb), so 1 K corresponds 5.2439e-15 erg /cm^2 /s /arcsec^2
  - log S = -14.2803
- log R = (−0.242 ±0.0042) log S − (4.2 ±0.057)
- log R = -0.7442
- R = 10**-0.7442 = 0.1802 pc

- The [S II] density is 125 \pm 40 from Corradi
- With an angular radius of \theta in arcsec, the radius is
  R = 4.8481e-03 \theta D_kpc pc
- So this gives an alternative way of estimating the VEM
  - assuming a filling factor of f for the dense gas
- VEM = (4 pi / 3) n^2 R^3 f = 7.46e-03 \theta^3 D_kpc^3 f pc^3 cm^-6
- The flux is dominated by the inner shell, with radius \theta \approx 9 arcsec and filling factor of about 0.5
- So this implies VEM = 2.72 D_kpc^3 pc^3 cm^-6
- Comparing this with the Ha-derived VEM above gives D_kpc =  60.25  / 2.72 = 22.15, which makes no sense!
- But from Frew:2016a it seems that we should be using the full size of the nebula (not sure why this makes sense), which they measure at the 10% isophote and take geometric mean of minor and major
  - This gives 20 and 26 arcsec for diameters, mean of 22.80, but it should be radius, so 11.4
  - So R = 0.0553 D_kpc pc
- Intrinsic flux is 3.7995e-12
  - So surface brightness is S = F / \pi \theta^2 = 9.31e-15 flux/arcsec^2 or *3.96e-04 erg cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1*
  - log10 S = -3.40
  - For optically thin nebulae, the relation should be
    - log SHα = −3.75(±0.11) log r− 5.73(±0.07).
    - with a dispersion of 20% in distance
    - => log R = (-3.40 + 5.73) / −3.75 = -0.62 +/- 0.03
    - R = 0.24 pc
    - => D_kpc = 4.34
  - D = 4.34 +/- 0.30 kpc
- This is good, but better to use the more recent statistical distance scales (see below), and then we can compare [S II] density with rms density
** RMS density
- n_rms = sqrt(VEM / V)
  - sqrt((49.9210 +/- 19.7051) cm^-6 / 4.7731e-07 \theta^3 D_kpc)
  - (1.0 +/- 0.2) 1e4 / sqrt(\theta^3 D_kpc)
  - Arguably, the filling factor f should also go in that sqrt 
  - With long distance scale
    - n = 122.5 pcc
    - remarkably close to the [S II] value, but this is assuming no filling factor

  - \mu =(2.266 × 10^-21 p^-5 \theta^3 F_5)^0.5
  - p = 0.001 / D_kpc
  - \mu = sqrt(2.266e-6 D_kpc^5 \theta^3 F_5)
- For Ou 5
  - D = 4.5 if we accept long scale
  - \theta = 11.4
  - F_5 = 3.2 +/- 0.4
  - \mu = sqrt(2.266e-6 4.5**5 11.4**3 (3.2 +/- 0.4)) = 4.4524 +/- 0.2783

- Recent papers on statistical distances
  - Frew, Parker, & Bojicic 2016
    - This is what I used above with the electron density method
    - The general result is
      : log SHα = γ log r + δ.
      - For the general population they find \gamma = -3.63 ± 0.06,  \delta = -5.32 ± 0.05
        - This is the result from Table 12. There is a slight inconsistency with equation 17 in the text, which has \delta = -5.34 ± 0.05. There is also a sign error in \delta in equation 16
          if we take the negative \delta values from the table
        - log R = (1/\gamma) log SHα - (\delta / \gamma) = (-0.2776 +/- 0.0046) log SHα - (1.4656 +/- 0.0279)
        - *Ou 5*
          - log R = (-0.2776 +/- 0.0046) -3.40 - (1.4656 +/- 0.0279) = -0.5218 +/- 0.0320
          - R = 0.3007 +/- 0.0222 pc
      - For the optically thin nebulae they find \gamma = -3.75 ± 0.11, \delta = -5.73 ± 0.07
        - log R = (-0.2667 +/- 0.0078) log SHα - (1.528 +/- 0.0486)
        - So that is offset fainter by 0.4 dex at the high radius end, and slightly steeper (so the offset is less at smaller radii)

        : log S(H\beta) = (-4.132 +/- 0.072) R - (17.355 +/- 0.382)
      - However, their S seems to be in units of per square arcsec (although they do not say this), so there is an additional offset of log10(206265**2) = 10.629. In addition, we have that Ha/Hb = 2.9. Taking this into account,  we get

        - R = 0.2044 +/- 0.0277
        - Considerably smaller than the Frew value
      - Alternatively, convert surface brightness to Bucciarelli units
        - S(H\beta) = 3.10e-15 erg /s /cm^2 /arcsec^2
          - log S(H\beta) = -14.5086
        - log R = (−0.242 ±0.0042) (-14.5086) −(4.2 ±0.057)
        - log R = -0.6889 +/- 0.0834
          - Note that the error given here is overestimated since it is calculated assuming the error in the intercept and slope are uncorrelated, whereas they are actually highly correlated. Better to use the dispersion in the radii about the mean relation of 0.06
        - R = 0.2047 +/- 0.0393
    - Finds correction to the Frew 2016 distance scale (FPB) of
      : ⟨K_FPB⟩= ⟨D_FPB ×ϖc⟩ = 1.272
      - I think this means that the FPB distances are overestimated by 1.272
    - They also find a secondary dependence on the ionized mass
      - This is similar to the separate trends found by FPB for optically thin and optically thick nebulae
      - Their Fig 3 shows this.
      - Taking this into account for *Ou 5*, we can take the result for M_i \approx 0.1 M_suns
      - For log S(H\beta) = -14.5 this is log R = -0.79 approximately
        - This is about 0.1 dex smaller than the mean, which is the same as the offset from the mean of the optically thin nebulae in Frew

      - 1og(D) = 1.3817 - 0.465 log10(11.4) - 0.268 log10(3.2 +/- 0.4) = 0.7549 +/- 0.0145
      - D = 10**(0.7549 +/- 0.0145) = 5.8722 +/- 0.1899
      - Much further away!!
    - But we really should do the offset for the low ionized mass of 0.1 dex in R, so we need to transform this relation to the (log R, log T_b) plane
      - R in pc, \theta in arcsec, D in kpc
      - log R = log D + log \theta + log (1000 au / pc)
      - *log R - log D - log \theta relation*
        - log R = log D + log \theta - 2.3144
      - log R = 1.3817 - 0.465 log \theta - 0.268 (log T_b + 2 log \theta - 1.2463) + log \theta - 2.3144
        - Note that the log \theta terms cancel completely (to a 0.001 precision), as expected
      - *AAMA22 log R - log T_b relation*
        - log R = -0.268 log T_b - 0.5987
        - This is consistent with the graph in Figure 4 of Ali paper
      - Note: slope is more similar to FPB16 (-0.2667 +/- 0.0046) than to BS23 (−0.2420 ±0.0042)
      - Check with Ou 5 values:
        - log R = (-0.268) (-0.362410214161) - 0.5987 = -0.5016
        - R = 0.3151 pc
        - D = 206.3 (R / 11.4) = 5.7022 kpc
        - Almost the same as last time, not sure why it is not exactly the same
      - Now apply the -0.1 dex shift
        - log R = -0.5016 - 0.1 = -0.6016
        - R = 0.2503 pc => D = 4.5296 kpc *Final AAMA22 distance*
  - Smith 2015
    - An older paper (pre Gaia), but seems more sophisticated in its statistical analysis than the later ones
    - 

* Radial density structure
- The inner shell is limb brightened
  - From the fits to the spatial profile along slit g, we get 
- But 

* Kinetic temperature from Ha widths
- Given the very similar distribution of the oiii and ha emission, it should be reliable to estimate the kinetic T from the Ha broadening
- We can do this from the gaussian fits along the central slits
- And could also do it for slit a, which has the narrowest widths because it is tangent to the barrel

* Velocity splitting measurements

* He II emission
+ We have lots of observations of the He II 6560 line
+ We could compare this with the Ha emission to get the ratio of ionizing photons in the two continua
+ But the trouble with that is that it is not clear if the H+ continuum is optically thick.
  + The [N II] emission is very weak, suggesting it might be thin
+ Alternatively, we could just find a He++ Zanstra temperature
  + How does that work exactly?
  + It requires knowledge of the continuum flux from the star at some reference wavelength, which we cannot do easily in this case because it is a binary
  + We would have to extract it from the light curve somehow, and this will be difficult since most of the flux comes from the cool component I think



* Co-added spectra
+ We can add together all the slits that are close to the axis of the nebula, in order to get better signal-to-noise
+ This should work fine, since we have very little variation across the minor axis
