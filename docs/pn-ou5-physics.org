* Empirical measurements
- Diameters:
  - Inner shell
    - 9 to 12 arcsec
    - mean 10.4 \pm 0.4
    - [[id:22069844-53A0-4130-8CF6-B86D0526053F][details here]]
  - Outer shell
    - end bits have diameter of 16 to 17 arcsec
  - Third shell (cone and fishtails)
    - 26 arcsec, but very uncertain
- Heights
  - Both shells have a sharpish outer boundary
  - Inner shell
    - 16 or so    
  - Outer shell
    - 26 or so
    - although co-added spectrum would argue for 32
- Aspect ratios: H / D
  - inner 16 / 10.4 +/- 0.4 = 1.54 +/- 0.06
  - outer 26 / 16.5 = 1.58 with large uncertainty
  - these are amazingly consistent
- Velocity splitting
  - [[id:478343AB-FDFD-4EA9-A338-FFC7B0809E0C][Details given below]]
  - Inner shell
    - 26 km/s
  - Outer shell
    - 37 km/s
  - Third shell
    - 70 km/s
  - D / V
    - Inner: 0.4
    - Outer: 0.43
    - Third: 0.37
    - So almost the same for all of them within 10%

This is different from what I measured in the slit G of 8.7

So I now get arccos(1.1 +/- 0.3 / 10.4 +/- 0.4) = 84 +/- 2

*** More sophisticated shell measurements
- See the notebook [[file:../notebooks/04-01-coadd-slits.py][04-01-coadd-slits]] in section "Minor axis spatial profile"
- I look at fitting gaussians to the brightness profile of a thick cylindrical shell with inner, outer radii r_in, r_out
- Results as follows:
  - Gaussian peak radius is \approx r_in
  - Gaussian fwhm is \approx 1.7 (r_out - r_in)
  - So thickness H = (r_out - r_in) \approx 0.6 FWHM
  - And mean radius = 0.5 (r_out + r_in) \approx PEAK + 0.3 FWHM
- For the inner shell on the equator, I find
  - PEAK = 4.4 arcsec
  - FWHM = 7.4 arcsec
- Implying
  - r_in = 4.4 \pm 0.2
  - H = 3.7
  - r_out = 8.1 \pm 0.2
  - mean r = 6.6
  - mean diameter D = 13.2
- *So I need to reconcile this with the above measurements*
  - It means that the diameters I have above are from the peaks, so are the inner surface
    - So we all agree that this is about 9 arcsec on the equator
    - For the velocities, we need to check that the peak of the line profile corresponds to the inner edge

- Strangely, this is smaller than the seeing width
* Emission measure
- From Corradi:2014j we have the observed total H alpha flux of the nebula
  - F(Hα)= 8.5e−13 erg cm−2 s−1
- And radio flux
  - 3.6 ± 0.5 mJy at 1.4 GHz.
    - Conversion to 5 GHz should be as F \propto \nu^-0.1
    - So F_5 = 3.2 +/- 0.4 mJy 
  - We can relate the radio surface brightness: I = F / \pi \theta^2 to the brightness temperature in the Rayleigh Jeans limit
    - T_b = (c^2 / 2 \nu^2 k) I_\nu
    - 1 Jy = 1e-23 erg /s /cm^2 / Hz
    - From below we are estimating \theta = 11.4 arcsec, so \Omega = \pi \theta^2 = 408.3 sq arcsec = 9.5964e-09 sr
    - At 5GHz, we have  (c^2 / 2 \nu^2 k) = 1.3019e+17
    - So T = 1.3019e+17 (3.2 +/- 0.4) 1e-3 1e-23 / 9.5964e-09 = 0.4341 +/- 0.0543 K
  - General relation T_b = (c^2 / 2 \nu^2 k) F_5 mJy / \pi \theta^2 (1/206265)**2
    - T_b = 17.6311 F_5 / \theta^2
    - *log T_b - log F_5 - log \theta relation*
      - log T_b = 1.2463 + log F_5 - 2 log \theta
      - log F_5 = log T_b + 2 log \theta - 1.2463
  - Supposedly
    F(Hα) = 1.73e-10 erg cm−2 s−1 (S_{1.4} / mJy)
  - I do not think this is right. It should be about 1e-12
- This means that the intrinsic Ha flux is
  - 1e-12 3.6 = 3.6e-12 = 4.2 times observed flux
- So c(H a) = log10(4.2) = 0.62
- Relation between c(Ha) and c(Hb)
  - Frew cites the Howarth (1983) reddening law
  - For the Galaxy this is
    : X(x)= R + 2.56 (x-1.83)-0.993 (x-1.83)2
    - where X is A_\lambda/E(B-V) and x = 1 micron / \lambda
  - But that is only valid for x < 1.83, which excludes Ha. They have another fit for longer wavelengths
    : [(1.86 - 0.48 x) x - 0.1] x 
  - Table for R = 3.1 (final column uses appropriate X for short and long wavelength)

  - This implies c(Ha) / c(Hb) = 1.07/1.58 = 0.68
- So c(H b) = 0.62 /0.68 = 0.912
  - whereas the paper says 1.23 +/- 0.3 for c(H b) derived in this way
  - perhaps because they are using the T = 13 kK, which will reduce the conversion factor a bit
  - From the Balmer lines they find c(Hb) = 0.95 ± 0.25 assuming R_V = 3.1
    - so intrinsic / observed Ha flux is 10**(0.68 (0.95 ± 0.25) ) = 4.4259 +/- 1.7325
    - so intrinsic flux is 8.5e−13 (4.4259 +/- 1.7325) = (3.8 +/- 1.5)e-12  erg cm−2 s−1
    - so that is a 40% uncertainty in the flux, which is mainly due to uncertainty in the reddening correction
- Ha luminosity = 4 pi D^2 F = 5.4817e+32 D_kc^2 erg/s = 0.1435 D_kpc^2 L_sun
- Conversion to VEM
  - H alpha emissivity = 4 pi j = 3.1e-25 erg cm^3 / s
  - VEM = \int n_e n_p d V = L / 4 pi j = 1.77e+57 D_kpc^2 cm^-3 = 60.25 D_kpc^2 pc^3 cm^-6
- Total recombination rate
  - \alpha_B VEM = 3.83e+44 D_kpc^2 s^-1

* Electron density
- The [S II] density is 125 \pm 40 from Corradi
- With an angular radius of \theta in arcsec, the radius is
  R = 4.8481e-03 \theta D_kpc pc
- So this gives an alternative way of estimating the VEM
  - assuming a filling factor of f for the dense gas
- VEM = (4 pi / 3) n^2 R^3 f = 7.46e-03 \theta^3 D_kpc^3 f pc^3 cm^-6
- The flux is dominated by the inner shell, with radius \theta \approx 9 arcsec and filling factor of about 0.5
- So this implies VEM = 2.72 D_kpc^3 pc^3 cm^-6
- Comparing this with the Ha-derived VEM above gives D_kpc =  60.25  / 2.72 = 22.15, which makes no sense!
- But from Frew:2016a it seems that we should be using the full size of the nebula (not sure why this makes sense), which they measure at the 10% isophote and take geometric mean of minor and major
  - This gives 20 and 26 arcsec for diameters, mean of 22.80, but it should be radius, so 11.4
  - So R = 0.0553 D_kpc pc
- Intrinsic flux is 3.7995e-12
  - So surface brightness is S = F / \pi \theta^2 = 9.31e-15 flux/arcsec^2 or *3.96e-04 erg cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1*
  - log10 S = -3.40
  - For optically thin nebulae, the relation should be
    - log SHα = −3.75(±0.11) log r− 5.73(±0.07).
    - with a dispersion of 20% in distance
    - => log R = (-3.40 + 5.73) / −3.75 = -0.62 +/- 0.03
    - R = 0.24 pc
    - => D_kpc = 4.34
  - D = 4.34 +/- 0.30 kpc
    - 

* Distance determinations
- *Summary*
  - Angular radius is 11.4 arcsec from geometric mean of major and minor axes of the 10% brightness contour (Frew+ 2016)
  - De-reddened Ha flux is (3.8 +/- 1.5)e-12 erg /s /cm^2
    - Ha mean surface brightness: 9.3073e-15 +/- 3.6739e-15 per square arcsec
      - 3.9598e-04 +/- 1.5631e-04 per steradian
      - log(S(Ha)) = -3.4023 +/- 0.1714
    - Hb mean surface brightness: 3.1024e-15 +/- 1.2246e-15
      - log(S(Hb)) = -14.5083 +/- 0.1714
    - All these S are proportional to assumed \theta^-2
  - Radius from surface brightness:
    - BS23
      : log RPN = (−0.242 ±0.0042) ×log S Hβ−(4.2 ±0.057)
      - with an additional offset of -0.1 dex for optically thin nebulae (low ionized mass)
      - Slope of about 1/4 means that 0.2 dex uncertainty in S becomes 0.05 in R
      - log R = (−0.242) (-14.5083 +/- 0.1714) − (4.2 ±0.057) - 0.1
      - log R = -0.7890 +/- 0.0705
        - Roughly equal contributions to uncertainty from intrinsic flux (mainly reddening uncertainty) and dispersion about mean surface brightness relation
      - R = 10**(-0.7890 +/- 0.0705) = 0.1626 +/- 0.0264 pc
    - FPB16
      - log R = (-0.2667) (-3.4023 +/- 0.1714) - (1.528 +/- 0.0486) = -0.6206 +/- 0.0667
      - R = 10**(-0.6206 +/- 0.0667) = 0.2396 +/- 0.0368 pc
    - AAMA22
      - R = 0.2503 pc, no errors
  - Distance
    - D / kpc = (R / pc) / (\theta / arcsec) / (1000 au / pc)
    - D = 206.3 (R / \theta)
    - BS23: D = (2.9425 +/- 0.4777) kpc
    - FPB16: D = (4.3359 +/- 0.6660) kpc
    - AAMA22: D = 4.5296 kpc
    - The difference is *approximately* consistent with the values
      : ⟨K⟩= 0.964, where K= D×ϖc, and ⟨σK ⟩= 0.154
      that they find for their scale
      : ⟨K_FPB⟩= ⟨D_FPB \times \varpi_c⟩ = 1.272
      that they find for FPB16
    - As an aside, I do not understand why their best distance scale dies not have K=1 by definition, but never mind.
      
  - \theta dependence
    - S \sim \theta^-2 and R \sim S^{-1/4}, so R \prop \theta^{1/2}, so D \sim \theta^{-1/2}
- Recent papers on statistical distances
  - Frew, Parker, & Bojicic 2016
    - This is what I used above with the electron density method
    - The general result is
      : log SHα = γ log r + δ.
      - For the general population they find \gamma = -3.63 ± 0.06,  \delta = -5.32 ± 0.05
        - This is the result from Table 12. There is a slight inconsistency with equation 17 in the text, which has \delta = -5.34 ± 0.05. There is also a sign error in \delta in equation 16
          if we take the negative \delta values from the table
        - log R = (1/\gamma) log SHα - (\delta / \gamma) = (-0.2776 +/- 0.0046) log SHα - (1.4656 +/- 0.0279)
        - *Ou 5*
          - log R = (-0.2776 +/- 0.0046) -3.40 - (1.4656 +/- 0.0279) = -0.5218 +/- 0.0320
          - R = 0.3007 +/- 0.0222 pc
      - For the optically thin nebulae they find \gamma = -3.75 ± 0.11, \delta = -5.73 ± 0.07
        - log R = (-0.2667 +/- 0.0078) log SHα - (1.528 +/- 0.0486)
        - So that is offset fainter by 0.4 dex at the high radius end, and slightly steeper (so the offset is less at smaller radii)
        - *Ou 5*
          - log R = (-0.2667 +/- 0.0078) (-3.40) - (1.528 +/- 0.0486) = -0.6212 +/- 0.0554

      : log RPN = (−0.242 ±0.0042) ×log S Hβ−(4.2 ±0.057)
      - I can convert this for comparison with the Frew result
        : log S(H\beta) = (-4.132 +/- 0.072) R - (17.355 +/- 0.382)
      - However, their S seems to be in units of per square arcsec (although they do not say this), so there is an additional offset of log10(206265**2) = 10.629. In addition, we have that Ha/Hb = 2.9. Taking this into account,  we get
        : log S(H\alpha) = (-4.132 +/- 0.072) R - (6.264 +/- 0.236)
      - Convert their original log R equation to use Ha and per steradian for surface brightness
        - Assume Ha/Hb = 3
        - log R = (−0.242 ±0.0042) × (log S(H\alpha) - log(3) - 10.629) − (4.2 ±0.057)
        - log R = (−0.242 ±0.0042) log S(H\alpha) - (1.5123 ±0.057)
      - *Ou 5*
        - log R = (−0.242 ±0.0042) (-3.40) - (1.5123 ±0.057) = -0.6895 +/- 0.0588
        - R = 0.2044 +/- 0.0277
        - Considerably smaller than the Frew value
      - Alternatively, convert surface brightness to Bucciarelli units
        - S(H\beta) = 3.10e-15 erg /s /cm^2 /arcsec^2
          - log S(H\beta) = -14.5086
        - log R = (−0.242 ±0.0042) (-14.5086) −(4.2 ±0.057)
        - log R = -0.6889 +/- 0.0834
          - Note that the error given here is overestimated since it is calculated assuming the error in the intercept and slope are uncorrelated, whereas they are actually highly correlated. Better to use the dispersion in the radii about the mean relation of 0.06
        - R = 0.2047 +/- 0.0393
    - Finds correction to the Frew 2016 distance scale (FPB) of
      : ⟨K_FPB⟩= ⟨D_FPB ×ϖc⟩ = 1.272
      - I think this means that the FPB distances are overestimated by 1.272
    - They also find a secondary dependence on the ionized mass
      - This is similar to the separate trends found by FPB for optically thin and optically thick nebulae
      - Their Fig 3 shows this.
      - Taking this into account for *Ou 5*, we can take the result for M_i \approx 0.1 M_suns
      - For log S(H\beta) = -14.5 this is log R = -0.79 approximately
        - This is about 0.1 dex smaller than the mean, which is the same as the offset from the mean of the optically thin nebulae in Frew
      - R = (0.162  +/- 0.0187) pc
  - Hernandez-Juarez 2024
    - They actually have our nebula in their catalog

    - So it has a naive parallax distance of 40 kpc, but that is obviously nonsense
    - It also has \delta p / p bigger than unity, so clearly the parallax is not reliable
  - Ali et al 2022
    - Uses Gaia DR3 to calibrate a Tb-R relation (same as surface brightness but for radio)
    - They go all the way to providing the distance equation
      : 1og(D) = 1.3817 - 0.465 log 0 - 0.268 l0g F5GHz•
      With no error bars on any of the coefficients!
    - If we use that as is we get
      - 1og(D) = 1.3817 - 0.465 log10(11.4) - 0.268 log10(3.2 +/- 0.4) = 0.7549 +/- 0.0145
      - D = 10**(0.7549 +/- 0.0145) = 5.8722 +/- 0.1899
      - Much further away!!
    - But we really should do the offset for the low ionized mass of 0.1 dex in R, so we need to transform this relation to the (log R, log T_b) plane
      - R in pc, \theta in arcsec, D in kpc
      - log R = log D + log \theta + log (1000 au / pc)
      - *log R - log D - log \theta relation*
        - log R = log D + log \theta - 2.3144
      - log R = 1.3817 - 0.465 log \theta - 0.268 (log T_b + 2 log \theta - 1.2463) + log \theta - 2.3144
        - Note that the log \theta terms cancel completely (to a 0.001 precision), as expected
      - *AAMA22 log R - log T_b relation*
        - log R = -0.268 log T_b - 0.5987
        - This is consistent with the graph in Figure 4 of Ali paper
      - Note: slope is more similar to FPB16 (-0.2667 +/- 0.0046) than to BS23 (−0.2420 ±0.0042)
      - Check with Ou 5 values:
        - log R = (-0.268) (-0.362410214161) - 0.5987 = -0.5016
        - R = 0.3151 pc
        - D = 206.3 (R / 11.4) = 5.7022 kpc

    - An older paper (pre Gaia), but seems more sophisticated in its statistical analysis than the later ones

* Radial density structure
- The inner shell is limb brightened
  - From the fits to the spatial profile along slit g, we get 
- But 

* Kinetic temperature from Ha widths
- Given the very similar distribution of the oiii and ha emission, it should be reliable to estimate the kinetic T from the Ha broadening
- We can do this from the gaussian fits along the central slits
- And could also do it for slit a, which has the narrowest widths because it is tangent to the barrel

* He II emission
+ We have lots of observations of the He II 6560 line
+ We could compare this with the Ha emission to get the ratio of ionizing photons in the two continua
+ But the trouble with that is that it is not clear if the H+ continuum is optically thick.
  + The [N II] emission is very weak, suggesting it might be thin
+ Alternatively, we could just find a He++ Zanstra temperature
  + How does that work exactly?
  + It requires knowledge of the continuum flux from the star at some reference wavelength, which we cannot do easily in this case because it is a binary
  + We would have to extract it from the light curve somehow, and this will be difficult since most of the flux comes from the cool component I think



* Co-added spectra
+ We can add together all the slits that are close to the axis of the nebula, in order to get better signal-to-noise
+ This should work fine, since we have very little variation across the minor axis
