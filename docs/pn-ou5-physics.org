* Comments on the paper


* He II emission
+ We have lots of observations of the He II 6560 line
+ We could compare this with the Ha emission to get the ratio of ionizing photons in the two continua
+ But the trouble with that is that it is not clear if the H+ continuum is optically thick.
  + The [N II] emission is very weak, suggesting it might be thin
+ Alternatively, we could just find a He++ Zanstra temperature
  + How does that work exactly?
  + It requires knowledge of the continuum flux from the star at some reference wavelength, which we cannot do easily in this case because it is a binary
  + We would have to extract it from the light curve somehow, and this will be difficult since most of the flux comes from the cool component I think



* Co-added spectra
+ We can add together all the slits that are close to the axis of the nebula, in order to get better signal-to-noise
+ This should work fine, since we have very little variation across the minor axis
